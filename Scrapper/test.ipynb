To kick start the day at work, I will have my daily reviews with my team to analyze where we could improve compared to how we performed a day earlier. I had a great team of collections analysts who were not only good at what they did but also believed in team work. It gave me an opportunity to understand the OTC specter of business better. The best part of the job was that I had to work closely with people across functions and across levels. ; A normal start of the day with review. Learnt merchandising and communication.Management is awesome and really supportive. Having a team like this is really a fun while you work.Hardest part of the job, i do no feel there is something hard in a job, however, every job has some ups and down, it is you who manages the things accordingly.Communication is the most intersecting part of my job. ; While working the last 3+ years as a System engineer, I have gained considerable knowledge and experience in managing and troubleshooting all Linux operations and applications in the internal systems.

No timely promotions and less hike percentage. No defined career path and proper guidance by managers ; I was responsible for troubleshooting critical issues like Faulty IP/ Digital/ Analog Extension which has no dial tone, unable to dial out with calling restriction of outgoing/ incoming calls, unable to Boot up from DHCP which has faulty ports assigned, unable to forward calls etc., and escalate.

Report the daily status to the reporting managers. Follow up with the previous works if anything pending. while ending up the shift, handover the job status to the next shift person. ; A day's work involves taking numerous calls and trying to resolve the queries of the customers, which helps connect with people of varied background and in turn helps your communication skills and interpersonal skills. The management is very jovial and forthcoming. There is no cabin system for anyone, hence everyone is accessible to everyone. My colleagues were very outgoing and supportive. The hardest part of the job was documenting each call within the given SLA. ; Hp has a good workplace for the employees who work especially for ladies, it is completely a secure office. It treats equally all the employees. It is more transparent to approach the high level managers. ; Its a place of maturing your skill and lots of flexibility at work.
