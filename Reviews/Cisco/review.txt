The division I work for here in Austin maintains a 60/40 contractor to employee ratio so converting to full time is exceedingly difficult regardless of performance.  There's also annual layoffs every August which is a serious moral killer and a shut down for two weeks every Christmas which is very hard on those 60% contractors who miss half a months pay during the holidays.  While management does a very good job of giving lip service to valuing their employees their policies do not mirror that sentiment.  Also while looking around this building at the amazing collection of technical talent, that talent is not utilized very effectively.  Management does not seem to understand or respect the skill sets required and often falls into just allocating whatever task to whomever they think might have bandwidth at that moment using the reasoning; \"They're smart, they'll figure it out.\"  And while employees do \"figure it out\" with amazing regularity someone learning as they go will not implement best practices, plan for scalability, consider security, interoperability or supportability the way an actual expert with experience would.  The end result is they often paint themselves into corners and suffer from quality problems that were avoidable. ", " Cisco is a very demanding company.

The division I work for here in Austin maintains a 60/40 contractor to employee ratio so converting to full time is exceedingly difficult regardless of performance.  There's also annual layoffs every August which is a serious moral killer and a shut down for two weeks every Christmas which is very hard on those 60% contractors who miss half a months pay during the holidays.  While management does a very good job of giving lip service to valuing their employees their policies do not mirror that sentiment.  Also while looking around this building at the amazing collection of technical talent, that talent is not utilized very effectively.  Management does not seem to understand or respect the skill sets required and often falls into just allocating whatever task to whomever they think might have bandwidth at that moment using the reasoning; \"They're smart, they'll figure it out.\"  And while employees do \"figure it out\" with amazing regularity someone learning as they go will not implement best practices, plan for scalability, consider security, interoperability or supportability the way an actual expert with experience would.

", " Once a truly innovative company, in recent years Cisco has grown primarily through acquisition of smaller companies that are doing something right with their products and services, but Cisco doesn't take time to learn from these companies to benefit from what they have learned and what they have found is working with their customers, so it can be properly institutionalized into Cisco's culture.  Instead, Cisco has focused more and more on Wall Street performance in recent years, rewarding executives, but stripping these acquired companies of critical performers, continuing to reduce the amount of expertise on staff in favor of less experienced and temporary contract labor that reduces short term OpEx.  This results in more people taking longer to accomplish what was once done by fewer people in shorter time frames, often forcing Cisco to over-promise and under-deliver.  While the Cisco UCS data center platform was likely one of the best investments Cisco has made in recent years, Cisco was still late into Video &amp; Content, late into Virtualization and Cloud Computing, and late into Big Data &amp; Analytics.  If Cisco would concentrate a little less on short term market performance and could listen to its customers more and listen to the companies it acquires more rather than dismissing the experts and critical, strategic thinkers that made them successful and a target for Cisco acquisition in the first place, it would likely find that its market performance would take care of itself.

Saves them money in the end.  3) If you dont mind managers being across the globe as well as changing every 11 months, you are a perfect fit. I did not mind the managers being globally spaced out. I did mind that they changed every 11 months just prior to your evaluation which they use to recommend your salary rates.

Employees would consistently show up late, work from home without permission, or just not show up at all.  Management has done little to nothing to fix the issue.

My co-workers were very friendly and very helpful.  The biggest caveat for an hourly-wage contract position is their December break, which is a week-long office closing around that coincides with Christmas and New Year's.  This arrangement poses no problems to a salaried employee, but an hourly employee loses one quarter of his or her salary for that month.

If you stay in the same company for too long, they forget who you are, never grant you a raise and expect you to quit. Saves them money in the end.  3) If you dont mind managers being across the globe as well as changing every 11 months, you are a perfect fit. I did not mind the managers being globally spaced out. I did mind that they changed every 11 months just prior to your evaluation which they use to recommend your salary rates.

The company and leadership played to my strengths as an employee, so I held compelling positions in a variety of different disciplines.  However, Cisco is at something of a cross-roads in terms of where they'll go next. Hardware margins are ever-eroding, Technical Services revenues are solid, but aren't going to push the company to another $10 Billion in revenues, and Professional Services (Advanced Services at Cisco) growth will likely have to come from cannibalizing the solid business of their primary hardware partners.  Over the course of the past four years or so, the nature of leadership at the company has changed. There's less of an emphasis on hiring from within, more cronyism, and overall less productivity. The divide between executives and employees is ever increasing, and the emphasis for career development is less on disruption and assertive innovation in favor of marginal improvements.
