", " I worked in Localisation QA for about 3 years, as Tester and Team Lead. In general lines I can tell that this is not a bad job, actually it can be very rewarding if you like this kind of job. Moreover Sony offers better working conditions than most companies in the industry. You will meet nice people and have some fun. So it looks like it may be a good job. But...  The problem is not the job itself, but the department management. Long story short, the line managers are uptight and narrow minded. They may be unfair in some occasions, they can mix personal and professional issues, and everybody cares just about covering their own back.  They never ask employees for feedback, they never listen to Testers, they don't like initiatives, they don't like criticism, they don't care. The rule is \"don't think, just obey\".  Team Leads look down on Testers. A Tester can be told off for any reason. They can make an official complain against you for pressing the exit door button too hard, or making a joke that someone consider unappropriated. They can take any criticism or something that you disagree with them as a sign of disrespect, and eventually face you with Human Resources for this.  Most of the Team Leads lack basic skills, knowledge and experience. Moreover they are not flexible, they don't solve problems, they don't take any initiatives or risks.They are terrified of making any mistake or disappointing the Producer. They don't care about doing a efficient work, but being safe themselves.  Team Leads encourage Testers to tell on other Testers and to brag about their achievements ", "<span class=\"cmp-review-text\"> at work (and some of them do it with pleasure). You never know who is going to stab you in the back (especially when people are fighting for a promotion).  In this department, the highest valued skill is to be a brown nose. It doesn't matter if someone have little experience, poor skills and average performance, these people still have a higher chance of having a good performance review and eventually a promotion, if they are good lap dogs, instead of people who are more skilled and experienced, but they dare to disagree with the management about something.  The internal affairs are not transparent but quite obscure and very often Testers or even Team Leads don't know what is going on in the department e.g. a Lead or a Supervisor disappears overnight without explanation, except for a brief official email confirming that the person is no longer with us. Later on I found out off the records that the person was \"invited to leave\" for unclear reasons, after many years of service without problems... And because all this lack of information, there are always gossips around and you never know what is true.  Many veteran Testers are frustrated, and many people defines the atmosphere in Localisation QA as \"Orwell's 1984\".

On of the only retailers I've ever heard or seen of tracking it in this manner.   It was a disappointment that the store was closing as we tried to grasp for positions in the company, many of us took the opportunity (and severance package) and tried to expand into other sales fields. ", " I have 3 years working experience at one of the biggest, Japanese global electronic manufacturing company as an engineer. I was assigned to support production in quality issue related to parts. Working with Japanese has taught me about the importance of qualities in product as well as in task delivered. They emphasize on team work rather than individual achievement and the importance of keeping time to the job assigned has developed me over the years. I was also supervising few subordinates from multiracial background in helping me with daily task. This has helped me to understand more in working with cultural diversity and not to be biased to one another. I also act as Shift Supervisor working 12 hours/day to support production.  I also well versed with computed productivity software such as Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, Power Point and Outlook) and Oracle which can be considered from intermediate to advanced level. I can also managed technical machine such as microscope, grinding machine and x-ray machine. Due to my responsibility which need to feedback analysis of defective parts, I need to send it to vendor for further root cause analysis. This has taught me about supply chain management and logistics where I need to communicate with planning team for replacement part and export team for returning of defective parts. ", " The typical day at Sony was adjusting daily diary schedules for the SVP and Director, arranging travel itinerary's as required including hotels and taxi arrangements.  Ensuring the CPCE Department was looked after in any requests for meeting rooms, catering, travel arrangements, meeting scheduling.  My co-workers were very welcoming and very helpful with my settling into the dept.  I was introduced to the latest version of Microsoft office, the various video conferencing systems:- ie Virtual mtg room, live mtgs and office communicator aswell as using the traditional video conferencing point to point mtg.  I was also introduced to their internal online systems for expenses using Concur, raising purchase orders and the Radios travel booking system. IT virtual help-desk and the online Facilities Management system.  The hardest part of the job was whilst organising an inter office desk move and keeping Facilities and H&amp;S out of carrying out the move but with persuasion they agreed that the staff could move their own belongings and therefore the dept did not incur extra costs for the move.  The most enjoyable part of the job was finishing an online expenses form for one of the team, using Concur, and it being approved for payment, with various elements where it could be posted incorrectly it was a sense of achievement each time it went through..! ", " Sony was a fun place to work at. Each day was the same, but different at the same time. There was always opportunities to better yourself by working with others and learning new technics so that you preformed more efficiently. Most of my co-workers were very easy to work with and for the most part we all got along well with each other. Management had their ups and downs as far as communicating well others. This may have been due to the fact that expansion was at a very high rate of speed for several years and things seemed to change almost on a daily basis. The hardest part of my job was probably keeping up to date on the ever-changing W/I (work instructions), to ensure proper procedures were being followed by all. The things that I enjoyed the most about working with Sony was that I felt great about doing a job well and being told by my supervisor that my work had been noticed by the upper management. Most of my co-workers and I worked well with each other and learned from each others experiences. ", " A day would consist of getting everyone together first thing after clocking in and once we have everyone in order we are all handed our tasks for the day and go right ahead to get started. Usually as the work day goes on each employee would complete a task and then report to our supervisor for another. This was another company that I was able to learn how to use multiple equipment in order to get tasks done for the day. Other things would consist of the complete shipping process such as picking, staging, lableing, and bill of lading per shipment. Management was a good priority here which was noticeable because there were multiple supervisors throughout the department running their own little groups for each process of the shipping department. Other employees that would work in the same department usually had their own tasks to get done for the day which was a good way to distribute the work load but by the end of the day we would normally end up together in order to wrap up the day. Hardest part of this job would be cylce counts. They would have the same material throughout the warehouse so your task would consist of finding each location, counting, and matching it to their numbers from the system to verify. Would not have been so bad if all of the same material were together in one location of the warehouse. The most enjoyable part of the job was that there was not only one supervisor that you must report to for help but multiple. ", " A typical day at Sony would generally be an update on where I stood with my projects with my direct line manager.  Depending on the priority or urgency I would tackle each project accordingly. A priority each day would be to touch base with each vendor in order to see where we stood on the projects.  I learnt a great deal in terms of corporate governance as well as time keeping in respect to outlining projects. I do not have a project management degree but I can humbly be grateful for the International education I received through local and expat staff on how to achieve the goals required for each project and can confidently say that I had managed to achieve at least 95% of my goals.   Co-workers to be honest with you became like family due to the fact that we were often in a situation of ''a sinking ship'' so we pulled together quite easily under the competitive circumstances and International direction.   Hardest part of my job was facing the reality of closure but still have the will power to fight it and try and keep the division open. I had in my time @ SONY survived 4 retrenchments before complete closure so the mental sadness of seeing some of your colleagues which became dear friends was slightly punishing.  Best part was the fact that we still had budget:):):) to complete most of the signed off projects. That and the people if I look back now were truly wonderful people from all crazy different backrounds that I will cherish forever, but in saying that look forward and am extremely excited to meet the amazing people of CT I have missed so much. ", " I find it a bit disingenuous that successful staffing agencies are capable of advertising the availability of multiple positions to potential employees, but solely provide staff for a single corporation after the fact. SONY DADC being the perfect example in the Terre Haute (IN) area. The turnover rate is ridiculous. Why? The Upper staff (Trainers, Line Leads, Supervisors [and Cores, to an extent]) mismanage relevant information and scheduling, while simultaneously neglecting employee training.   Be aware: Your supervisors will mock you. To your face. While on the line (SPA), you will be discussed at length by all individuals present. The unnecessary drama that unfolds on each shift can be overwhelming. If you are hired, expect to work long hours (12 hour shifts). This will impact you socially. You will be forced to implement new routines. Sony will become your life. You will be tired. (Large portions of this branch rely on stimulants to maintain active lifestyles, while others imbibe depressants to deaden the pain standing still for 12 hours will initially cause). Sadly. Until you quit. Be sure to give notice. (Also: Layoffs are frequent after the Holiday seasons have passed.)  The pay is minimal: $9.00-$10.00 per hour (depending on your agency.) The work is simple assembly and post-fab production. The process is monotonous, and inactivity is constant. The position is not recommended for those suffering from any Back Problems or Physical Ailments.   Line Leads can, and will, be ruthless. The scaling systems and matrices used in the SPA rely on - Graded Speed, Production ", "<span class=\"cmp-review-text\"> Estimates, and Output to determine a casual percentage which will reflect the Leads ability to maintain stable production at speed. Usually, the typical employee is a \"pair of hands\". If you can't maintain proper speed (100%-125%), you will be moved.   I would advise you to stay away, but if steady income is your priority, then this position may be for you. Overtime Days are abundant (and often mandatory.) Opportunities for promotion, though few and far between, are possible.   Frankly, this industry cannot sustain itself. Digital distribution has dated physical products (DVD, Blu-Ray, CD). Still, if you need cash, Sony DADC will hire anyone (through Temp Services). They always need fodder. ", " I worked in Localisation QA for about 3 years, as Tester and Team Lead. In general lines I can tell that this is not a bad job, actually it can be very rewarding if you like this kind of job. Moreover Sony offers better working conditions than most companies in the industry. You will meet nice people and have some fun. So it looks like it may be a good job. But...  The problem is not the job itself, but the department management. Long story short, the line managers are uptight and narrow minded. They may be unfair in some occasions, they can mix personal and professional issues, and everybody cares just about covering their own back.  They never ask employees for feedback, they never listen to Testers, they don't like initiatives, they don't like criticism, they don't care. The rule is \"don't think, just obey\".  Team Leads look down on Testers. A Tester can be told off for any reason. They can make an official complain against you for pressing the exit door button too hard, or making a joke that someone consider unappropriated. They can take any criticism or something that you disagree with them as a sign of disrespect, and eventually face you with Human Resources for this.  Most of the Team Leads lack basic skills, knowledge and experience. Moreover they are not flexible, they don't solve problems, they don't take any initiatives or risks.They are terrified of making any mistake or disappointing the Producer. They don't care about doing a efficient work, but being safe themselves.  Team Leads encourage Testers to tell on other Testers and to brag about their achievements ", "<span class=\"cmp-review-text\"> at work (and some of them do it with pleasure). You never know who is going to stab you in the back (especially when people are fighting for a promotion).  In this department, the highest valued skill is to be a brown nose. It doesn't matter if someone have little experience, poor skills and average performance, these people still have a higher chance of having a good performance review and eventually a promotion, if they are good lap dogs, instead of people who are more skilled and experienced, but they dare to disagree with the management about something.  The internal affairs are not transparent but quite obscure and very often Testers or even Team Leads don't know what is going on in the department e.g. a Lead or a Supervisor disappears overnight without explanation, except for a brief official email confirming that the person is no longer with us. Later on I found out off the records that the person was \"invited to leave\" for unclear reasons, after many years of service without problems... And because all this lack of information, there are always gossips around and you never know what is true.  Many veteran Testers are frustrated, and many people defines the atmosphere in Localisation QA as \"Orwell's 1984\". So, in a nutshell, it is a job that could be quite good, but some people there are working hard to ensure they make your life miserable.
