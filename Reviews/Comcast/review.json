The environment is very stressful and you have to work very hard to make your goals month to month.  There is a lot of shady business that goes on that will get you fired if you aren't careful so you have to make sure you aren't selling unethically.  Management and staff are both overworked so it doesn't allow much time for work life balance.  Going into the situation it isn't hard to tell why there is a high turnover rate.  If you can stand it, you may be able to grow with the company but I wouldn't look forward to it.  The best advice I can offer is get in, get what you can and get out quickly without turning back. Even the benefit of free service isn't worth the headache.  BUYER BEWARE! ", ' Comcast provides its employees the ability to really stretch their legs with gaining new experiences in skill sets and the latest technology. However management there is hampered in keeping employees in the company due to poor HR practices that force lower compensation and low raises. Go for the experience and take that on to your next position in your career. Plus there is free cable if your full time. I would warn against being a contractor there though, you WILL be considered a second class citizen. ', " Excellent company with a great attitude towards employees. Easy advancement and promotions within. Working for Comcast you realize that the most important product to sell is the Customer Experience. With a positive attitude and a little hard work any customer can be satisfied, and/or won over. Excellent rapport between management and co-workers, and fun work environment. Even after deciding to relocate and have the unfortunate luck of not being able to transfer due to travel distance, management still tried every effort to find something for me. What company would do that? I really enjoyed working with them and will cherish everything I've learned and experienced. ", " Great company to work for. Tons of career advancement opportunities. The benefits are fantastic and its fun place to work at. A large percentage of the employees have been with the company for over 15 years. The company cares about its employees and constantly solicits feedback to make the work environment better. Each geographic area has a physical Comcast University to help with employee development. In addition to classes related to the employees job, Comcast University offers non related course to help employees develop their careers. Its not uncommon to see management bring in lunch for the employees on occasion or develop fun team building activities. The company is also civic minded and is known for it's Comcast Cares Day.

If bugs are found they ar reported to developers and they fix it and then I retest them. when all test case pass the build is ready to be released. Time to time I report my work to my Project manager.It is a great place to work where people are always helpful and encourage growth. The hardest part of the job is meeting deadlines. Management could be improved a little bit. The most enjoyable part of the job is hanging around with some good coworkers ', ' As an outside Account Executive, my days started in the office confirming appointment, calling on clients, making presentations, signing new business and cold calling. As a Business to Business sales professional, I was fortunate to be a part of Comcast rolling out new data and voice services for the first time in central Arkansas.  Having come from the telecom industry, I identified new revenue streams that resulted in me attaining some of the highest new revenue sales ever in the local market. The culture was well defined and clear goals and objectives were set.   The hardest part of my job was leaving.  New sales policy eliminated compensation for some of the new revenue that I was leading with.    I enjoyed working with my peers developing new products, leading the launch to the marketplace and working with customers. ', " Great job opportunity , day to day operations were ran smoothly. Gained a great ordeal of knowledge in WFX and CSG as well as understanding the quota portion of Field operations. A huge lack of management assistance at times we wouldn't have any management on the floor or during shifts. Hardest part of the job was having to figure things out by trial and error or by spending some time with other departments . Enjoyable parts of the job were the hours 4am-1pm early start to the day although had plenty of time  afterwards to be able to get personal things accomplished (ie. Doctor's appointments , errons etc.) ", " You have a lot of flexibility but as well as high expectations in getting your work done. Our partners is our primary concern. There's never a day in which you don't learn anything new. Management is down to earth, supportive, and actually cares about your career growth. They are transparent and give you enough incentives to keep you there. Coworkers are easy going and you can get along with just about anyone. Hardest part is that there's not enough hours in a day to complete your projects and you can end up sacrificing your own personal hours to please a partner or two. ", " No opportunity for growth here. Middle managers make a lot of money and stay for a very long time. Account Executives are considered second rate employees, and are required to manage an enormous work load with no direction or leadership. Compensation is poor and changes every year. There is no possibility for creative input, work/home balance or flexibility. Comcast does offer excellent benefits. If you work very hard and don't mind being micro-managed, you can make some decent money, but base salaries are very low, and commission structure is very confusing. ", ' Company offers excellent benefits and great compensation package.  Department I was in had a highly political and stressful work environment with a poor work/life balance.

I can either climb a ladder, enter a crawl space, or simply install inside a customer's home.  I have learned quite a bit working for Comcast.  I have learned the basics of cable installation, also how to communicate with customers and troubleshoot their problems.  The management is very helpful and supportive.  My coworkers are very friendly and funny.  The hardest part of the job would have to be working out in all of the weather. The best part of the job is interacting with customers and learning more and more about my job. ", " I work mostly without direct supervision. I am given minimal requirements and goals and it is up to me to achieve them.  I am responsible for contacting residents to get them to sign up for Comcast cable. And to follow up to maintain good customer service.  I have consistently not only exceeded minimal goals, but have produced well over the 100% mark.  Coworkers know they can call me for assistance with procedure or service issues.  Management also relies on me for training new hires and for taking charge if they are out of the office for any extended time.  The job is not easy since we have, currently, a low customer service image and not all people like our product. But it is not me they don't like so it is not personal.

The environment is very stressful and you have to work very hard to make your goals month to month.

If you can stand it, you may be able to grow with the company but I wouldn't look forward to it.  The best advice I can offer is get in, get what you can and get out quickly without turning back.

Even after deciding to relocate and have the unfortunate luck of not being able to transfer due to travel distance, management still tried every effort to find something for me. What company would do that? I really enjoyed working with them and will cherish everything I've learned and experienced. ", " Great company to work for. Tons of career advancement opportunities.

In addition to classes related to the employees job, Comcast University offers non related course to help employees develop their careers. Its not uncommon to see management bring in lunch for the employees on occasion or develop fun team building activities. The company is also civic minded and is known for it's Comcast Cares Day.

The environment is very stressful and you have to work very hard to make your goals month to month.  There is a lot of shady business that goes on that will get you fired if you aren't careful so you have to make sure you aren't selling unethically.  Management and staff are both overworked so it doesn't allow much time for work life balance.  Going into the situation it isn't hard to tell why there is a high turnover rate.  If you can stand it, you may be able to grow with the company but I wouldn't look forward to it.  The best advice I can offer is get in, get what you can and get out quickly without turning back. Even the benefit of free service isn't worth the headache.  BUYER BEWARE! ", ' Comcast provides its employees the ability to really stretch their legs with gaining new experiences in skill sets and the latest technology. However management there is hampered in keeping employees in the company due to poor HR practices that force lower compensation and low raises.

In addition to classes related to the employees job, Comcast University offers non related course to help employees develop their careers. Its not uncommon to see management bring in lunch for the employees on occasion or develop fun team building activities. The company is also civic minded and is known for it's Comcast Cares Day.

As a Business to Business sales professional, I was fortunate to be a part of Comcast rolling out new data and voice services for the first time in central Arkansas.  Having come from the telecom industry, I identified new revenue streams that resulted in me attaining some of the highest new revenue sales ever in the local market. The culture was well defined and clear goals and objectives were set.   The hardest part of my job was leaving.

I enjoyed working with my peers developing new products, leading the launch to the marketplace and working with customers. ', " Great job opportunity , day to day operations were ran smoothly. Gained a great ordeal of knowledge in WFX and CSG as well as understanding the quota portion of Field operations. A huge lack of management assistance at times we wouldn't have any management on the floor or during shifts.

Doctor's appointments , errons etc.) ", " You have a lot of flexibility but as well as high expectations in getting your work done. Our partners is our primary concern. There's never a day in which you don't learn anything new. Management is down to earth, supportive, and actually cares about your career growth. They are transparent and give you enough incentives to keep you there. Coworkers are easy going and you can get along with just about anyone. Hardest part is that there's not enough hours in a day to complete your projects and you can end up sacrificing your own personal hours to please a partner or two. ", " No opportunity for growth here. Middle managers make a lot of money and stay for a very long time. Account Executives are considered second rate employees, and are required to manage an enormous work load with no direction or leadership. Compensation is poor and changes every year.

And to follow up to maintain good customer service.  I have consistently not only exceeded minimal goals, but have produced well over the 100% mark.  Coworkers know they can call me for assistance with procedure or service issues.  Management also relies on me for training new hires and for taking charge if they are out of the office for any extended time.  The job is not easy since we have, currently, a low customer service image and not all people like our product. But it is not me they don't like so it is not personal.

Management and staff are both overworked so it doesn't allow much time for work life balance.  Going into the situation it isn't hard to tell why there is a high turnover rate.  If you can stand it, you may be able to grow with the company but I wouldn't look forward to it.  The best advice I can offer is get in, get what you can and get out quickly without turning back.

In addition to classes related to the employees job, Comcast University offers non related course to help employees develop their careers. Its not uncommon to see management bring in lunch for the employees on occasion or develop fun team building activities. The company is also civic minded and is known for it's Comcast Cares Day.

Having come from the telecom industry, I identified new revenue streams that resulted in me attaining some of the highest new revenue sales ever in the local market. The culture was well defined and clear goals and objectives were set.   The hardest part of my job was leaving.

Hardest part is that there's not enough hours in a day to complete your projects and you can end up sacrificing your own personal hours to please a partner or two.

Coworkers know they can call me for assistance with procedure or service issues.  Management also relies on me for training new hires and for taking charge if they are out of the office for any extended time.  The job is not easy since we have, currently, a low customer service image and not all people like our product. But it is not me they don't like so it is not personal.

', " You've all heard about the reputation of Comcast. Well everything you heard is true.  The pay is mediocre, the benefits are ok if free services are what you seek.  The environment is very stressful and you have to work very hard to make your goals month to month.  There is a lot of shady business that goes on that will get you fired if you aren't careful so you have to make sure you aren't selling unethically.  Management and staff are both overworked so it doesn't allow much time for work life balance.  Going into the situation it isn't hard to tell why there is a high turnover rate.  If you can stand it, you may be able to grow with the company but I wouldn't look forward to it.  The best advice I can offer is get in, get what you can and get out quickly without turning back. Even the benefit of free service isn't worth the headache.  BUYER BEWARE! ", ' Comcast provides its employees the ability to really stretch their legs with gaining new experiences in skill sets and the latest technology. However management there is hampered in keeping employees in the company due to poor HR practices that force lower compensation and low raises. Go for the experience and take that on to your next position in your career. Plus there is free cable if your full time. I would warn against being a contractor there though, you WILL be considered a second class citizen. ', " Excellent company with a great attitude towards employees. Easy advancement and promotions within. Working for Comcast you realize that the most important product to sell is the Customer Experience. With a positive attitude and a little hard work any customer can be satisfied, and/or won over. Excellent rapport between management and co-workers, and fun work environment. Even after deciding to relocate and have the unfortunate luck of not being able to transfer due to travel distance, management still tried every effort to find something for me. What company would do that? I really enjoyed working with them and will cherish everything I've learned and experienced. ", " Great company to work for. Tons of career advancement opportunities. The benefits are fantastic and its fun place to work at. A large percentage of the employees have been with the company for over 15 years. The company cares about its employees and constantly solicits feedback to make the work environment better. Each geographic area has a physical Comcast University to help with employee development. In addition to classes related to the employees job, Comcast University offers non related course to help employees develop their careers. Its not uncommon to see management bring in lunch for the employees on occasion or develop fun team building activities. The company is also civic minded and is known for it's Comcast Cares Day. On this day employees around the country volunteer by offering their time on community improvement projects. Supplies and materials are paid by Comcast. ", ' In the morning having a stand up meeting where we discuss what was done yesterday, what we did today and what impediments I had. Then go on to write my test cases and execute them for completed builds and if new builds come I do smoke testing first. If smoke testing pass, then go on to full manual testing. If bugs are found they ar reported to developers and they fix it and then I retest them. when all test case pass the build is ready to be released. Time to time I report my work to my Project manager.It is a great place to work where people are always helpful and encourage growth. The hardest part of the job is meeting deadlines. Management could be improved a little bit. The most enjoyable part of the job is hanging around with some good coworkers ', ' As an outside Account Executive, my days started in the office confirming appointment, calling on clients, making presentations, signing new business and cold calling. As a Business to Business sales professional, I was fortunate to be a part of Comcast rolling out new data and voice services for the first time in central Arkansas.  Having come from the telecom industry, I identified new revenue streams that resulted in me attaining some of the highest new revenue sales ever in the local market. The culture was well defined and clear goals and objectives were set.   The hardest part of my job was leaving.  New sales policy eliminated compensation for some of the new revenue that I was leading with.    I enjoyed working with my peers developing new products, leading the launch to the marketplace and working with customers. ', " Great job opportunity , day to day operations were ran smoothly. Gained a great ordeal of knowledge in WFX and CSG as well as understanding the quota portion of Field operations. A huge lack of management assistance at times we wouldn't have any management on the floor or during shifts. Hardest part of the job was having to figure things out by trial and error or by spending some time with other departments . Enjoyable parts of the job were the hours 4am-1pm early start to the day although had plenty of time  afterwards to be able to get personal things accomplished (ie. Doctor's appointments , errons etc.) ", " You have a lot of flexibility but as well as high expectations in getting your work done. Our partners is our primary concern. There's never a day in which you don't learn anything new. Management is down to earth, supportive, and actually cares about your career growth. They are transparent and give you enough incentives to keep you there. Coworkers are easy going and you can get along with just about anyone. Hardest part is that there's not enough hours in a day to complete your projects and you can end up sacrificing your own personal hours to please a partner or two. ", " No opportunity for growth here. Middle managers make a lot of money and stay for a very long time. Account Executives are considered second rate employees, and are required to manage an enormous work load with no direction or leadership. Compensation is poor and changes every year. There is no possibility for creative input, work/home balance or flexibility. Comcast does offer excellent benefits. If you work very hard and don't mind being micro-managed, you can make some decent money, but base salaries are very low, and commission structure is very confusing. ", ' Company offers excellent benefits and great compensation package.  Department I was in had a highly political and stressful work environment with a poor work/life balance.   Professional respect in the workplace was sometimes lacking.  Management at times exhibits questionable ethics.  Teams consisted primarily of offshore contractors from one country, so diversity was lacking. ', " A typical day at work usually is not so routine.  I can either climb a ladder, enter a crawl space, or simply install inside a customer's home.  I have learned quite a bit working for Comcast.  I have learned the basics of cable installation, also how to communicate with customers and troubleshoot their problems.  The management is very helpful and supportive.  My coworkers are very friendly and funny.  The hardest part of the job would have to be working out in all of the weather. The best part of the job is interacting with customers and learning more and more about my job. ", " I work mostly without direct supervision. I am given minimal requirements and goals and it is up to me to achieve them.  I am responsible for contacting residents to get them to sign up for Comcast cable. And to follow up to maintain good customer service.  I have consistently not only exceeded minimal goals, but have produced well over the 100% mark.  Coworkers know they can call me for assistance with procedure or service issues.  Management also relies on me for training new hires and for taking charge if they are out of the office for any extended time.  The job is not easy since we have, currently, a low customer service image and not all people like our product. But it is not me they don't like so it is not personal. Also, walking for hours outdoors in the summer can put a strain on you. But with the benefits and income, you can get past those and meet a large variety of people and learn a lot from them. ", ' Comcast is a fast paced family oriented company that provides opportunities and career growth to their employees.  Great company for entry level employment. Training is ongoing for all levels.  Management teams work well together to keep an upbeat atmosphere in a innovated company that is always making changes. The employees work hard as a team to get the job done.

The environment is very stressful and you have to work very hard to make your goals month to month.  There is a lot of shady business that goes on that will get you fired if you aren't careful so you have to make sure you aren't selling unethically.  Management and staff are both overworked so it doesn't allow much time for work life balance.  Going into the situation it isn't hard to tell why there is a high turnover rate.  If you can stand it, you may be able to grow with the company but I wouldn't look forward to it.  The best advice I can offer is get in, get what you can and get out quickly without turning back. Even the benefit of free service isn't worth the headache.  BUYER BEWARE! ", ' Comcast provides its employees the ability to really stretch their legs with gaining new experiences in skill sets and the latest technology. However management there is hampered in keeping employees in the company due to poor HR practices that force lower compensation and low raises.

A huge lack of management assistance at times we wouldn't have any management on the floor or during shifts.

Doctor's appointments , errons etc.) ", " You have a lot of flexibility but as well as high expectations in getting your work done. Our partners is our primary concern.

Hardest part is that there's not enough hours in a day to complete your projects and you can end up sacrificing your own personal hours to please a partner or two.

Coworkers know they can call me for assistance with procedure or service issues.  Management also relies on me for training new hires and for taking charge if they are out of the office for any extended time.  The job is not easy since we have, currently, a low customer service image and not all people like our product. But it is not me they don't like so it is not personal.

The environment is very stressful and you have to work very hard to make your goals month to month.  There is a lot of shady business that goes on that will get you fired if you aren't careful so you have to make sure you aren't selling unethically.  Management and staff are both overworked so it doesn't allow much time for work life balance.  Going into the situation it isn't hard to tell why there is a high turnover rate.  If you can stand it, you may be able to grow with the company but I wouldn't look forward to it.  The best advice I can offer is get in, get what you can and get out quickly without turning back. Even the benefit of free service isn't worth the headache.  BUYER BEWARE! ", ' Comcast provides its employees the ability to really stretch their legs with gaining new experiences in skill sets and the latest technology. However management there is hampered in keeping employees in the company due to poor HR practices that force lower compensation and low raises.

Even after deciding to relocate and have the unfortunate luck of not being able to transfer due to travel distance, management still tried every effort to find something for me. What company would do that? I really enjoyed working with them and will cherish everything I've learned and experienced. ", " Great company to work for. Tons of career advancement opportunities. The benefits are fantastic and its fun place to work at. A large percentage of the employees have been with the company for over 15 years.

In addition to classes related to the employees job, Comcast University offers non related course to help employees develop their careers. Its not uncommon to see management bring in lunch for the employees on occasion or develop fun team building activities. The company is also civic minded and is known for it's Comcast Cares Day.

If bugs are found they ar reported to developers and they fix it and then I retest them. when all test case pass the build is ready to be released.

As a Business to Business sales professional, I was fortunate to be a part of Comcast rolling out new data and voice services for the first time in central Arkansas.  Having come from the telecom industry, I identified new revenue streams that resulted in me attaining some of the highest new revenue sales ever in the local market. The culture was well defined and clear goals and objectives were set.   The hardest part of my job was leaving.
