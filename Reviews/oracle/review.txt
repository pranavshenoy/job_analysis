The company has excellent pay and benefits once you've gotten to a senior level position.  The sales side of the company is extremely competitive and tends to lean more on the unethical and questionable side. You'll spend more time competing with other sales teams for Oracle products than actually competing with external forces. The comp structure on the sales side is crazy, but don't don't expect a solid base pay. Currently there is excessive pressure to push cloud services and cloud credits on customers. If you fight for your customer's best interests, you may get into trouble, so be careful.  The consulting side of the company is extremely understaffed, under trained, and stretched very thin. The higher up you climb in the consulting side, you more customers and products you'll have to cover. You'll spend most of your time either in pre-sales consulting support or post-sales janitor duty. A lot of consulting gigs at Oracle are horribly mismanaged and at the behest of the sales team to clean up after their poor judgement on solution positioning or on the customers dime to fix their mistakes.  The software development side can be challenging or fun, depending on which products you work on. More attention and money is given to business apps (Fusion, PSFT, ATG, EBS, etc.) and to middleware (Oracle DB, Weblogic, AIA/SOA, etc.). Less attention and money is given to the hardware and OS( Linux/Solaris) ", "<span class=\"cmp-review-text\"> side of the house due to the slim margins. The public cloud side of the software development is the place to be at today since all of the transformation work is going on there to get the Oracle stack into SaaS/PaaS services. Avoid jobs for products like Compute (Nimbula), Bare Metal, and SDN. These are problem areas where money and resources are being wasted in an internal arms race that is being poorly managed to catch up to AWS.  Management wise, Oracle is a solid place to build up your career and advice. However, make sure you avoid managing products or services that have slim margins. So do your research before jumping into a management position. Also, there is a lack of corporate level oversight and architecture to make sure that different products, services, and business units don't clash. So don't expect things to make a lot of sense.  The company can make very rapid and surprising business decisions that directly effect your organization and thusly job. The bottom line is of the most importance to the executives. So if your product, service, or business unit is not performing, don't be surprised when you are told to look at other jobs or axed. So making sure that you have a good management team is key to avoiding these situations. ", " Not the same company in 2016 that I joined in 1997.

Empresa dinamica, jovem e muito \"agressiva\" na conquista de seus negocios. ", " A rotina de trabalho \u00e9 tranquila. H\u00e1 um grande respeito entre as pessoas. O n\u00edvel de satisfa\u00e7\u00e3o tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 alto, uma vez que a empresa investe muito em benef\u00edcios e a\u00e7\u00f5es de qualidade de vida no trabalho. O meu aprendizado nessa empresa foi mais limitado, tendo em vista que, na \u00e9poca, eu n\u00e3o tinha maturidade suficiente para idealizar um prop\u00f3sito de crescimento pessoal e profissional. Mesmo assim, pude aprender algumas coisas como manusear o programa Excel, por exemplo. A dire\u00e7\u00e3o e ger\u00eancia da empresa possuem alto n\u00edvel de conhecimento e compet\u00eancia, entretanto, a rela\u00e7\u00e3o interpessoal com os demais colaboradores deixam uma conviv\u00eancia distante do ideal com o l\u00edder da empresa. Os colegas de trabalho mant\u00e9m a postura profissional muito s\u00e9ria impossibilitando um ambiente mais agrad\u00e1vel para trabalhar, mas nada que comprometa o desempenho individual. A parte mais dif\u00edcil foi lidar com \"v\u00e1rios\" chefes e ter que administrar conflitos entre eles e saber me sair. A parte mais agrad\u00e1vel \u00e9 a quantidade de benef\u00edcios e facilidades que a empresa oferece. ", " A mmi opini\u00f3n se requiere d eunmentor cuando se inciia en la organizaci\u00f3n de OPeraciones. No hay un equilibrio entre cargas de trabajo en puestos sencillos (baja carga de trabajao) vs. complejos (resultados sobrecardagos) Lo bueno es que el ambiente de trabajo es muy familiar ", " Oracle es una empresa que promueve la proactividad y la investigaci\u00f3n as\u00ed como el bienestar personal y la capacitaci\u00f3n. Mi equipo de trabajo es un grupo de profesionales altamente capacitados capacitados y amantes de la tecnolog\u00eda y con muchas ganas de aprender a diario. ", " N\u00f3s de TI sempre acumul\u00e1vamos varias fun\u00e7\u00f5es. No meu caso eu gerenciava a implanta\u00e7\u00e3o dos projetos de TI na Am\u00e9rica Latina e o grupo de HelpDesk da Am\u00e9rica Latina e tamb\u00e9m participava dos grupos mundiais de suporte a VoIP e encripta\u00e7\u00e3o de dados. N\u00e3o havia um dia t\u00edpico, coisas novas aconteciam todos os dias, cada dia era um dia, muitas reuni\u00f5es para tratar dos projetos, muitos calls para solucionar problemas atendidos pelo HelpDesk e pelos grupos mundias de suporte, muito trabalho. A dire\u00e7\u00e3o confiava no meu trabalho e me dava independ\u00eancia o que facilitava a minha tomada de decis\u00f5es. A parte mais agrad\u00e1vel do trabalho ? ver um projeto implantado, um problema resolvido. A parte mais dif\u00edcil do trabalho ? tentar agradar Gregos e Troianos nas decis\u00f5es de TI ", " El trabajo en Oracle ha gratificante ya que es un OEM reconocido mundialmente, te da las herramientas necesarias para desarrollar tu puesto. Aprendi trabajar en un ambiente diferente por ser OEM. ", " Aprend\u00ed y contin\u00fao aprendiendo multitud de aspectos nuevos del trabajo en el \u00e1rea. Procedimientos, programas, aplicaciones. Cultura multinacional. Disponibilidad de apoyo, cercan\u00eda de los managers. Lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil: Procedimientos muy jer\u00e1rquicos, en ocasiones lentos pero seguros. Lo que m\u00e1s me gust\u00f3: aprendizaje de multitud de conocimientos y destrezas en un sector muy din\u00e1mico donde todo es nuevo y hay que adaptarse continuamente. ", " Travailler chez Oracle \u00e9tait r\u00e9ellement un plaisir tout les jours. On avait transportation gratuite, bon environnement du travail, jour de la fruit, machine \u00e0 bonbon gratuite, plusieurs \u00e9v\u00e9nement pour les employ\u00e9es et la famille et plus. ", " Excelente empresa con prestaciones y excelentes oportunidades, sin embargo con un bajo conocimiento sobre el posicionamiento de soluciones especializadas y nulo nivel de capacitacion para sus empleados. ", " Sin duda es un empresa l\u00edder en el mercado de IT, completamente administrada bajo los procesos establecidos; limitada flexibilidad para obtener situaciones especiales de negocio. ", " Empresa muy enfocada a resultados donde logras aprender algo nuevo cada d\u00eda. Lo importante es cumplir los objetivos. La parte dif\u00edcil es aprender a manejar el stress provocado por la presi\u00f3n. Lo mas interesante las prestaciones de la empresa. ", " El realizar, coordinar los eventos siempre fue mi mayor pasi\u00f3n, disfrut\u00e9 mucho todas las funciones que desempe\u00f1aba dentro de Oracle, Estar d\u00eda a d\u00eda d\u00e1ndole seguimiento a dichos eventos, as\u00ed como tambi\u00e9n las necesidades que requer\u00edan los de ventas por parte de Marketing, me motivabaron para encontrar la mejor soluci\u00f3n para sus clientes quedando con una gran satisfacci\u00f3n vendedor y cliente.
