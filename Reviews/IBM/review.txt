The whole team lacked test devices which made development and testing difficult and inefficient.  Management was weak at times and felt that they didn't have a handle on various aspects of the team.  i.e: Some senior staff were too comfortable and arrogant, which prevented manager from fulfilling their role. Some staff were cut throat and did anything to protect their job even when they sucked!  Most difficult part of the job was that the team was scattered all over the country and communication was via conference calls.  There wasn't the face-to-face communication between your co-workers and manager to developer that personal relationship.  Manager with held important information that would impact the length of an existing contract.  i.e. Management didn't give a heads up about the lack of funding for resources and equipment and kept employee in the dark.

I sure that IBM in different countries are that all the same. ", " I came to IBM as most people do, as an employee of another company who's role is outsourced to IBM as part of a contractual arrangement for IBM to provide services previously provided inhouse.    Almost everything we were told about the way our jobs were going to be handled at IBM and how we would be treated at IBM was a lie or a gross exaggeration.  Despite promises of annual salary reviews, almost nobody received any pay increase, regardless of how well they performed in the appraisal process.  Every year there would be a different excuse as to why there had been no budget for raises.  The annual potential bonus is in the range of 0-12%, but it is almost impossible to attain any bonus greater than 6%, more often than not any bonus was in the 1-2% range, even for someone who received very good appraisals.  Salary grades each have their own salary ranges, which you may or may not be quoted prior to starting, but it is very important to be able to identify the midpoint of the salary range, because despite what the top end of the salary range may be, getting any pay rise or salary higher than the midpoint of the salary range is almost impossible, and it is company policy to stop employees earning more than the midpoint.   Level 1 managers are constantly overworked and under the pump from their seniors.  More senior management make work changes (such as making key employees redundant) with alarming regularity and without any rhyme or reason, leaving the L1 managers to deal with the aftermath of filling those roles with existing staff who were already stretched very thinly. ", "<span class=\"cmp-review-text\"> L1 managers are unable to provide support to their staff and more often than not technical managers are managing technologies which they have no prior experience with or knowledge of.  L1 managers are rarely in any role for any period of time in which they are able to make any real difference or improvements for their staff.  In 5 years at IBM I reported to 6 different managers, most of whom never actually had any idea what my role was or what it was that I did on a day to day basis, and were therefore unable to observe problems in the team or understand issues which I was bringing to them.  When they did attempt to resolve issues, they most often took the path of least resistance, being ignoring the best technical advice in favour of the solution which was simplest for them to achieve.    Although they sell themselves as a service company, service is far from a high priority at IBM.  They strive to attain the lowest level of contractual compliance with customers at the lowest possible cost.  Staff are often assigned tasks which they lack the skill or training to perform.    The company is run by accountants who constantly try to reduce expenditure (usually to the detriment of their employees, and the customers who their employees are struggling to service).  The rest of the company are box tickers.  Their project personnel will tick a box and move on to the next thing regardless of the level of completeness of the previous tasks.  As a result they are building systems which have passed the absolute minimum amount of pre-delivery testing, and handing those systems over to BAU teams who are then left to deal with many issues which are not picked up in the build phase.    Most long term employees at IBM (especially those who came into the company via outsourcing arrangements) are queueing up for redundancies.  It is a very sad reflection on a company when the staff receiving redundancies are congratulated by their peers and wish good luck to the poor suckers who are left behind.    I would never work for IBM again.  I would never recommend IBM as an employer to anyone.  IBM has no respect for or value of it's employees.  Employees are merely regarded as mere number on a page and treated as such with alarming regularity.  This is endemic within the whole organisation, from it's head office in Armonk NY to various client offices worldwide and it's own \"employee factories\" in India/Malaysia/Brasil.  As an employee reading reviews from other employees on websites such as GlassDoor and www.ibmemployee.com it is very apparent that the same culture permeates the entire organisation.  This is not just a few bad apples in the chain  it is an entire business culture, from the top down, in every IBM office worldwide. It is the American way of running businesses, where employees are a dispensable commodity and the share price and P/L report rule all decision making. ", " Worked at IBM for just under a year.

However, I never did get that benefit from DEC, and I had a very good time at IBM as a co-op, with fair pay, and was able to learn things I had not yet learned in school, in an atmosphere that was not lonely in any way--there was a great deal of support for co-ops.

", " My wife and I both worked for IBM for 18 and 11 years respectively.  My wife worked in finance and her worst manager was decent.  The only real complaint I can raise is that one manager demanded she stay late for a meeting and later canceled said meeting without informing my wife (keeping both of us late since we carpooled).  We finally had to call to find out it was canceled as much as an hour after the meeting time.  This is the ONLY incident I know of, for her, in the 18 years she was in finance with the company.  Me?  My managers were either very good, or quite bad.  Example: I was given an award and the man who put me in for the award called to congratulate me and revealed that he put me in for said award (he'd been working for IBM 30+ years at the time so had some ways of knowing things he should not have, like my award went through).  My manager stopped by just after he'd called and told me that IBM had changed their awards policies and thus it was not possible to give out many small awards, only singleton large awards.  My award was actually meant for the team, would I mind signing it over to him?  This basically took any joy or pride in the award away from me.  It was patently wrong, if not illegal.  I scared him away by talking about tax implications and I suspect that he had no way to work around that so backed off.  I DID share my award with my team by buying them gifts that year (it was very near Christmas time).  Another manager was known for choosing an employee and making his/her time at IBM so miserable, they would quit.  She chose me at one point. ", "<span class=\"cmp-review-text\">  During this (brief) time frame, another employee who'd shifted to another manager came back to work for her and this employees hands were literally shaking at the thought of working for my manager.  She indeed rode me, nitpicking every detail she could.  When I finally made a mistake (who wouldn't when pressured enough), she wrote me up on 13 accounts.  Every single one of the 13 problems she brought up was wrong!  It was niggling details in which she was wrong (wrong company in one case, but correct error).  My second line was 'ashamed that I was quibbling'.  My take is that if you are going to crater a career, you had better be correct when you bring forth the charges.  The fact that she made mistakes on ALL of them should reflect.  These are just two examples of the poor management that I have experienced at IBM.  Note that my experience was galvanically split between fantastic managers and very poor ones.  In fairness I should list a few 'good' examples but, they are of the nature of taking great care of employees on day to day basis (giving us time off during down periods, clear direction in job, etc) so it is a wee difficult to list examples.

Typically, these tenured employees are not very effective and have become dead wood further weighing down the company to cling to the past.   Newer hires and acquired employees eventually see IBM for what it is.  IBM will continue to treat employees like game pieces and cycle them through hiring, firing and layoffs at the whim of the quarterly financial forecast.  There is no loyalty to employees.  The finance team commits prior to each quarter how many people they will cycle out during the quarter and regardless of business performance or individual performance, they will lay these people off to meet their commitment of separation packages they have signed off on.  Employees are rarely allowed to transfer once notified in an RA due to this financial commitment to pay a package, regardless how much the company could benefit from the person moving into a new position.  Paying out the package is the only concern.  If this sounds backwards and counter intuitive; it is! IBM is currently assessing replacing all band 4 and below employees with contractors.

Culture  The SREV culture combines a traditional sales pressure cooker with a Google-esque progressive attittude.

The 'competitive culture' sales side of things is clearly effective and pervasive, however, for certain employees, including myself, competitiveness cannot exist with friendly co-operation.

", " The job ad said Java Application Developer at IBM, and it described what sounded like a Java Application Developer position - including coding in Java. I took a pay cut of $13,000 a year for a Java Application Developer position. What I got was a Tech Support job for a computer application (that wasn't even written in Java) that I had never used before. My training on it involved two weeks of training, where I was taught what to do when other people go on vacation.  The work I did was painfully boring (and trust me when I say that I have it better than a lot of other people there). I actually want to work, I wanted to be a Java Application Developer.   My Typical Day at work as Tech Support at IBM (or Java Application Developer if you prefer). I come in, I check my e-mail. I delete about 100 useless e-mails; perhaps I find one that is relevant to me. If I find one that is relevant to me, I address it to the best of my ability with my limited knowledge of the application I am supporting. I then proceed to teach myself something with online tutorials, play some chess, or peruse the Internet job boards looking for a new job. If I manage to get an interview, I leave for the interview.   I used to engage in the IBM training that is provided, but it is horribly boring and outdated, and after I did 400 hours of it (and taught myself Android programming on my own), I gave up on it. Any of the good training, IBM doesn't like to foot the bill for. Once there was a mobile development training going on in the building and I requested to attend, but I was told that it would take away ", "<span class=\"cmp-review-text\"> from my billable hours and they didn't want to pay for me to attend. I don't work during my billable hours most of the time, instead I am required to just continue to bill the customer (And Yes, there is mandatory overtime in my role) - who apparently doesn't realize that I don't do anything of any use to them and they are paying for really very little.  Around 12:00 I go to the break room and buy lunch from the restaurant that comes in everyday - oh, correction, IBM has now stopped that restaurant from coming in and selling us food. So I go to the coffee maker now and buy a coffee, and I leave for lunch (or a job interview depending upon the events planned for the day).   When I get back from lunch I check my e-mail, looking for the one relevant e-mail I may have gotten. By this time the guy who sits behind me is usually snoring, and someone else is on a phone interview with another company. I bet you thought I was the only person who looked for work while at work - I am not. I have never seen this behavior anywhere else. Most people don't look for new jobs while at work - but it seems rather common here.   On the other side of my cubicle will be a few people engaged in playing games on their computers, or watching YouTube videos. At least I am usually more productive than they are - except when I am allowed to work from home on Overtime Saturday, which usually means I check my e-mail a lot more and I watch Netflix all day. On normal days, I will proceed to look for more jobs. Lansing, Michigan is not really a booming job market right now. Although I have seen people come in, work here for a few months and quit. Some of them have done so and not even had another job lined up, but some of them have managed to find work. If everyone who was looking for a job there suddenly found one, I would bet that half the staff would be gone.  Some people may think this sounds like a great job. First off, I hate it. I actually want to do work. Secondly, it is really luck of the draw that I got this role. Other people have a substantial amount of work - most of them were hired in as I was, under the guise of Java Application Developer, but were put into testing roles. Their workloads vary. Some of them don't get any work to do all week until they are forced to work Saturday and then they have a lot of work to do on Saturday and spend 12 hours doing it. Others have to do 80 hours a week (these people make the same pay as me apparently) and actually have a lot of work. I know this as I have gone over to help them just to try and make my time here not completely worthless.   What really irritates me about this job is not the low pay. I knew this and accepted it. I was lied to blatantly (and I can prove it, I still have the offer letter). When I questioned the management about it, they told me they didn't currently have enough Java developer jobs and yet were that very day on-boarding new \"Java Application Developers\" who later ended up becoming testers.

In a high pace environment supporting so many employees, constant retraining was needed while maintaining delivery excellence for the client.  While managing was the most difficult part, it was also the most enjoyable.  I learned that it was very fulfilling to see an employee that I trained turn the corner into a fully functioning member of the team.  A great example would be a team member suggesting improvements on existing processes, showing that they didn't just learn these processes but truly understand them and have the will to enhance them.

", " My typical day at work would be to come in, log onto my Ticket-logging system, get my headset ready, then look at our Helpdesk Mailbox to action any e-mails while waiting for phone calls from clients. Since we provide a 2nd line support, occasionally, I would remotely connect to servers or user's machines to perform requests needed.  I have learned quite a lot since this was my first long-term contract. The first month when I was employed here, our entire team went for training from Microsoft to familiarize ourselves with the type of environment which we would be supporting. The advantage of this training is that it is internationally recognized and we had to write a series of exams to pass and receive our Certificate, also, the pass mark was 70% which meant that it was not the easiest of exams to pass. Also, once I began to assist Managers with their roles, myself and 2 of my colleagues got an opportunity for further training (ITIL v3 Foundation) with our Management team and team leaders, this would help us all understand the methodology and escalation processes that need to be followed in most IT environments.  The management team was very procedure-oriented but also positive and encouraged growth within the company. They did not however advise to use untried methods, but since there were other engineers and resources that did this, it had minimal impact on our support overall.  My co-workers were close to what I was when we started. For most of us, it was our first experience in a Corporate environment, we learnt to work together as a team and outside of office hours, ", "<span class=\"cmp-review-text\"> we would still be connected as a team, we would have a braai at the team leader's house for instance, or play volley ball or soccer. It was interesting to see how most of the team members grew out of their shells. While some of my team members grew within the company, having other qualifications than those in IT, some of us gathered the experience we had and managed to find employment elsewhere.  The hardest part of the job would be the working hours. Sometimes we had to work night shifts due to some of our clients being in a different time zone. This would result in our sleeping patterns not being normal, sleeping during the day and working night-shift. Also, because we provided international support, we could not take off public holidays unless they were international public holidays. That was also a bit of an adjustments since we did not have the luxury of visiting friends and family during public holidays. IBM however did compensate us for that by providing Public Holiday swaps for each day that we had to work on Public Holidays, and also provided us bigger opportunities when they needed employees to work overtime.  The most enjoyable part of the job. We had a lot of good things going for our jobs, our pay was decent for a helpdesk role, we had very good internet access, the procedures were mostly well-documented, the management team was fact-oriented and very well organized and even our HR team showed a lot of interest in each individual. The only problem within the Helpdesk role, you would get too comfortable with your job, and it became increasingly difficult to be interested with other aspects of your life.  I have applied for other growth positions within the company, but at the time, everyone was getting hit by the Global recession and IBM got affected quite badly, just like quite a number of blue-chip companies. It didn't help our cause that as a result, we lost several enterprise-sized clients, including some European banks which were hit hardest by the recessions.

This thus fosters and condones an environment of consultants all \"stretching the truth\" about their abilities and skills - just so that they are able to make it from project to project. (And, is there any wonder why IBM's US clients are leaving in droves? Imagine the quality of project teams that are a conglomeration of \"desperate\" consultants.) Employee moral is low, the multiple layers of ineffective management make it virtually impossible to get most anything accomplished and it is virtually impossible to get training outside of what is \"free\" / internal to the company (aka no investment in the employee).

IBM was always a family environment, with each office being close knit. Beyond the office, your fellow IBM'ers were supportive and focused on the same goals. IBM was hit hard with the economic downturns, and experienced the need to consolidate offices, causing physical office moves that were painful to long time employees.

There is no budget for managers to motivate their teams. Raises and promotions are far and in between. The appraisal system is tied to the budget, so if the budget is small, employees are given poor appraisals even though they don't deserve them. The politics are horrible. Top performers leave because they are not appreciated, and everyone else is eventually let go. The only people that seem to be happy are those who take assignments in the growth market countries. IBM's strategy is to build over in these countries, and US employees willing to go over and get shops set up seem to be rewarded handsomely. The only good thing left for US employees is the flexibility.

The most enjoyable part of the job was working with diverse groups within IBM and ISVs. They all had unique perspectives and requirements. There was always something new to learn. ", " IBM has a high starting salary for developers ($70K) but it offers very little raise and bonuses (if any) even if you are promoted.  The benefits are okay. They are being reduced year by year though.  The company does not care about employees and its overall prospect the is negative,   Career managers and career executives have run the company to the ground by gaming the books instead of innovating. The company tries to make up for its shortfall by regularly laying off people and cutting benefits/salaries/bonuses - instead of addressing why it is losing market share.  This causes many of the good people (including myself) to leave for greener pastures.  The management in IBM is over-bloated and inefficient. Politics between departments often pose severe obstacles to achieving business results. For instance, if we are to use an IBM product to serve a customer, then that product's department will try to rip us off by charging a premium (because that counts towards their quarterly results)  At other times, we can have departments rejected request of assistance to a customer by citing the request was improperly filed (in this case, it's my department doing it to others).  Job security is low if you are in a department that is not making a lot of money. On the other hand, if you are in a department that has good revenue, then you are also unlikely to be fired even if you are grossly incompetent.  In overall, IBM is a good place for people to start their career because it pays a fair amount for new graduates. It also gives people a taste of a typical corporate culture.

This however could be interrupted with urgent requests coming in and this is when you have to make adjustments and handle the urgent ones.  It's a very fast paced environment where adapt to change and making adjustments is a must.  The biggest part of my job was putting together the perfect solution for the client's needs.  To a customer, price is really important but I had to educate them on a total solution.  I had to review the client's inventory and make sure there's no coverage gaps so they would get the support they were intended on getting.  At times, you must get creative to meet the customer somewhere near their price point.  I had to be able to explain to the customer exactly what they will receive for their money.    At IBM, I learned what it takes to become a top Sales Rep.  They provided all the education and training required to be successful.  I had some of the best coworkers I could have asked for.  I have developed friendships for life.  Management at IBM is the best.  Every manager I had exercised an open door policy.  I could always get up and go into my manager's office to discuss sales opportunities or just to update them on anything that's going on.

If you are doing a good job and getting ahead of your work, your reward is to do more work, and/or pick up the slack for someone else who is not doing so well.  You are also rated against your peers at review time. So as a Band 7, you are rated against other Band 7s in your department. A percentage is rated 1, or 2+ or 2, the rest are 3s and 4s.

There is an assumption that employees will stick around no matter what because IBM believes employees should feel honored to work for \"Big Blue\".   In reality, the employees who have been around for a long time and were grandfathered into lucrative retirement plans will stick around until they retire if allowed to \"coast it out\". Typically, these tenured employees are not very effective and have become dead wood further weighing down the company to cling to the past.   Newer hires and acquired employees eventually see IBM for what it is.  IBM will continue to treat employees like game pieces and cycle them through hiring, firing and layoffs at the whim of the quarterly financial forecast.  There is no loyalty to employees.  The finance team commits prior to each quarter how many people they will cycle out during the quarter and regardless of business performance or individual performance, they will lay these people off to meet their commitment of separation packages they have signed off on.  Employees are rarely allowed to transfer once notified in an RA due to this financial commitment to pay a package, regardless how much the company could benefit from the person moving into a new position.  Paying out the package is the only concern.  If this sounds backwards and counter intuitive; it is! IBM is currently assessing replacing all band 4 and below employees with contractors.

CONS:  On-boarding for new staff is a major nightmare, as there is very little assistance offered to new staff in terms of navigating an enviroment that has been fractured, rebuilt, and retooled over decades. The company has moved to an absolute \"serve and support yourself\" model, that takes quite a bit of getting use to... once you have a general idea of what to look for, you will still feel totally flustered by the amount of useless links leading to links that bring you back to the original link! You will spend unbelievable wasted hours trying to gain access to tools you will use on a daily basis, and there is very little support to help you find what you need.  The organization is also \"slave driver\" mentality. I have first hand knowledge of an employee on my team being forced to boot his laptop in the middle of vacation (on-site at Disneyworld!) to revise an RFP for several hours. ", "<span class=\"cmp-review-text\"> The company does not at all value \"work-life balance\" no matter how many times they try to tell you that they do. Weekends are not \"days off\"... they are merely days when you decide what time you will continue working and for how long you will work.  SUMMARY: Working for IBM and being good at what you do can easily be the highlight of your career... they are to the rest of the technical services industry what the US Marine Corp is to the rest of the armed services... simply a dominant force that can accomplish anything they want to do.  I enjoyed working at IBM, but am not sure that I would want to repeat that experience at this stage in my career.

", " The job ad said Java Application Developer at IBM, and it described what sounded like a Java Application Developer position - including coding in Java. I took a pay cut of $13,000 a year for a Java Application Developer position. What I got was a Tech Support job for a computer application (that wasn't even written in Java) that I had never used before. My training on it involved two weeks of training, where I was taught what to do when other people go on vacation.  The work I did was painfully boring (and trust me when I say that I have it better than a lot of other people there). I actually want to work, I wanted to be a Java Application Developer.   My Typical Day at work as Tech Support at IBM (or Java Application Developer if you prefer). I come in, I check my e-mail. I delete about 100 useless e-mails; perhaps I find one that is relevant to me. If I find one that is relevant to me, I address it to the best of my ability with my limited knowledge of the application I am supporting. I then proceed to teach myself something with online tutorials, play some chess, or peruse the Internet job boards looking for a new job. If I manage to get an interview, I leave for the interview.   I used to engage in the IBM training that is provided, but it is horribly boring and outdated, and after I did 400 hours of it (and taught myself Android programming on my own), I gave up on it. Any of the good training, IBM doesn't like to foot the bill for. Once there was a mobile development training going on in the building and I requested to attend, but I was told that it would take away ", "<span class=\"cmp-review-text\"> from my billable hours and they didn't want to pay for me to attend. I don't work during my billable hours most of the time, instead I am required to just continue to bill the customer (And Yes, there is mandatory overtime in my role) - who apparently doesn't realize that I don't do anything of any use to them and they are paying for really very little.  Around 12:00 I go to the break room and buy lunch from the restaurant that comes in everyday - oh, correction, IBM has now stopped that restaurant from coming in and selling us food. So I go to the coffee maker now and buy a coffee, and I leave for lunch (or a job interview depending upon the events planned for the day).   When I get back from lunch I check my e-mail, looking for the one relevant e-mail I may have gotten. By this time the guy who sits behind me is usually snoring, and someone else is on a phone interview with another company. I bet you thought I was the only person who looked for work while at work - I am not. I have never seen this behavior anywhere else. Most people don't look for new jobs while at work - but it seems rather common here.   On the other side of my cubicle will be a few people engaged in playing games on their computers, or watching YouTube videos. At least I am usually more productive than they are - except when I am allowed to work from home on Overtime Saturday, which usually means I check my e-mail a lot more and I watch Netflix all day. On normal days, I will proceed to look for more jobs. Lansing, Michigan is not really a booming job market right now. Although I have seen people come in, work here for a few months and quit. Some of them have done so and not even had another job lined up, but some of them have managed to find work. If everyone who was looking for a job there suddenly found one, I would bet that half the staff would be gone.  Some people may think this sounds like a great job. First off, I hate it. I actually want to do work. Secondly, it is really luck of the draw that I got this role. Other people have a substantial amount of work - most of them were hired in as I was, under the guise of Java Application Developer, but were put into testing roles. Their workloads vary. Some of them don't get any work to do all week until they are forced to work Saturday and then they have a lot of work to do on Saturday and spend 12 hours doing it. Others have to do 80 hours a week (these people make the same pay as me apparently) and actually have a lot of work. I know this as I have gone over to help them just to try and make my time here not completely worthless.   What really irritates me about this job is not the low pay. I knew this and accepted it. I was lied to blatantly (and I can prove it, I still have the offer letter). When I questioned the management about it, they told me they didn't currently have enough Java developer jobs and yet were that very day on-boarding new \"Java Application Developers\" who later ended up becoming testers.   Whatever you do, DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT come to the East Lansing IBM center for work. STAY AWAY!!!!!!!! ", " Working in IBM was an enjoyable experience, but more importantly it was a company where every day was different and there were always opportunities to learn new skills. I worked in many different areas within the company and experienced many different styles of management through the variety of managers for whom I worked. Each manager had different goals and targets and it was always a challenge to adapt to the managers' style and to adjust and fit in with his existing team in a timely and efficient manner. The most difficult part of my job in the time I worked there was when I was managing Customer Complaints for all IBM Customers. During this time there was a worldwide issue which affected a large number of our largest customers. This time was so hectic and each customer had similar problems but each had slightly different issues. I was working 12/14 hour days as I was dealing with resolution teams all over Europe and the USA which meant I had to be available for conference calls from 9am to 9pm to cover all countries. This was stressful as the issues being experienced were extremely urgent and had to be resolved as soon as possible and with guaranteed solutions. That being said, I was extremely satisfied to have managed the resolution of the issues being experience by my customers in a timely manner, and to the satisfaction of my customers. The most enjoyable part of my job was the variety of different people I dealt with on a daily basis. Sometimes I worked as part of a team which was very rewarding and taught me even more about the importance of teamwork as I this was the ", "<span class=\"cmp-review-text\"> first time I had worked in a company of this size where communication with many different countries was a daily occurence. The most satisfying position I held was as Conflict Resolution Manager. I was the point of contact for the customer when they had a problem, which was essential, but within the company I dealt with most departments to try to organise and manage the resolution of the customers' issues. I also enjoyed the time I spent in the Train the Trainer programme. It was educational and challenging to be given the information on a new product or service after which I would then attend a training course. I would then return to Ireland and put together courses targeted at the different groups withing IBM Ireland depending on how involved each group would be with the new product or service. I would then teach the course to the different groups and be available for one to one training when necessary. I also handled the rollout of several new systems throughout the company and was available for one to training for any colleague who had difficulties with the installation or use of the new system. ", " My typical day at work would be to come in, log onto my Ticket-logging system, get my headset ready, then look at our Helpdesk Mailbox to action any e-mails while waiting for phone calls from clients. Since we provide a 2nd line support, occasionally, I would remotely connect to servers or user's machines to perform requests needed.  I have learned quite a lot since this was my first long-term contract. The first month when I was employed here, our entire team went for training from Microsoft to familiarize ourselves with the type of environment which we would be supporting. The advantage of this training is that it is internationally recognized and we had to write a series of exams to pass and receive our Certificate, also, the pass mark was 70% which meant that it was not the easiest of exams to pass. Also, once I began to assist Managers with their roles, myself and 2 of my colleagues got an opportunity for further training (ITIL v3 Foundation) with our Management team and team leaders, this would help us all understand the methodology and escalation processes that need to be followed in most IT environments.  The management team was very procedure-oriented but also positive and encouraged growth within the company. They did not however advise to use untried methods, but since there were other engineers and resources that did this, it had minimal impact on our support overall.  My co-workers were close to what I was when we started. For most of us, it was our first experience in a Corporate environment, we learnt to work together as a team and outside of office hours, ", "<span class=\"cmp-review-text\"> we would still be connected as a team, we would have a braai at the team leader's house for instance, or play volley ball or soccer. It was interesting to see how most of the team members grew out of their shells. While some of my team members grew within the company, having other qualifications than those in IT, some of us gathered the experience we had and managed to find employment elsewhere.  The hardest part of the job would be the working hours. Sometimes we had to work night shifts due to some of our clients being in a different time zone. This would result in our sleeping patterns not being normal, sleeping during the day and working night-shift. Also, because we provided international support, we could not take off public holidays unless they were international public holidays. That was also a bit of an adjustments since we did not have the luxury of visiting friends and family during public holidays. IBM however did compensate us for that by providing Public Holiday swaps for each day that we had to work on Public Holidays, and also provided us bigger opportunities when they needed employees to work overtime.  The most enjoyable part of the job. We had a lot of good things going for our jobs, our pay was decent for a helpdesk role, we had very good internet access, the procedures were mostly well-documented, the management team was fact-oriented and very well organized and even our HR team showed a lot of interest in each individual. The only problem within the Helpdesk role, you would get too comfortable with your job, and it became increasingly difficult to be interested with other aspects of your life.  I have applied for other growth positions within the company, but at the time, everyone was getting hit by the Global recession and IBM got affected quite badly, just like quite a number of blue-chip companies. It didn't help our cause that as a result, we lost several enterprise-sized clients, including some European banks which were hit hardest by the recessions.

These multiple service lines act as small companies within a bigger organization. The mutual relations between those service lines on a management level are far from healthy. A strong difference is that some service lines and their management truly invest and nurture young talent. But then you have others were your personal interests and academic background will be neglected (bad people management).  These dynamics, create a big contrast in working environments across service lines. When you don't fit in a particular service line and try to move to another that is more in line with your interest, be prepared to handle this with great caution as these transfers are openly not accepted within the organization.   As a business consultant you need to find your own projects through your own network with very limited help from resource planners. I was lucky to be able to engage in a couple of international projects that were aligned with my interests. When there aren't projects that are in your scope of interest, be prepared to suffer. As you'll probably be forced into roles that are far away from your interests and academic background.   Examples are people with a commercial background, industrial engineers, nanotechnologists, etc. who were obliged to work in very technical roles (e.g. testing) on a data migration projects for a long period of time (e.g. 6-12 months).

As you have are cost for the organization, you'll need to be billable in order to create value (bring in money). Although in the long run, management does not seem to care whether a young talent or professional is feeling happy within the company.   In general, there a lot of cool and international projects to participate in. But you'll have to be prepared and fight for these opportunities by doing everything yourself. Management will now always follow you in these personal initiatives and in what you would like to do within the organization. What usually happens is that they steer an individual in a particular direction without their full consent. As in any big company, you have a lot of politics and internal struggles.

Grandes empresas como a IBM tiveram que reduzir seus custos ao m\u00e1ximo, destinando recursos de or\u00e7amento para \u00e1reas estrat\u00e9gicas como vendas, log\u00edstica e marketing, deixando setores operacionais desfavorecidos quanto \u00e0 n\u00famero de funcion\u00e1rios e benef\u00edcios. O dia come\u00e7ava cheio, v\u00e1rios pa\u00edses tiveram filiais operacionais fechadas e o destino foi o Brasil. Todos os dias um alinhamento constante era feito com diversos pa\u00edses a fim de maturar os processos rec\u00e9m adquiridos. Diversas contas de clientes possu\u00edam diverg\u00eancias de faturamento geradas durante a transi\u00e7\u00e3o e por isso reconcilia\u00e7\u00f5es de contas, emiss\u00f5es de cr\u00e9ditos eram necess\u00e1rios durante boa parte do expediente. O dia inclu\u00eda tamb\u00e9m diversos treinamentos de novas equipes de processadores (40 pessoas treinadas por mim) e reuni\u00f5es de estrat\u00e9gia operacional. O ambiente \u00e9 extremamente din\u00e2mico com profissionais a altura de suas compet\u00eancias, pontuais, bem relacionados e flex\u00edveis. A parte mais agrad\u00e1vel era o conv\u00edvio com as pessoas e a divis\u00e3o do conhecimento. A parte mais dif\u00edcil era a abdica\u00e7\u00e3o quase total da vida pessoal (jornadas de trabalho de mais de 12 horas por dia eram vistas como normais e finais de semana e feriados eram tidos praticamente como dia \u00fatil.
