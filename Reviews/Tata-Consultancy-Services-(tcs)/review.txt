When you're on a project at a client site you're given a TCS manager, the problem is that they change on a regular basis as they usually return to India without notice or one day notice.  When this happens it is difficult to have someone to talk to about various matters and to try and advance within the company.  You usually end up talking to HR if they happen to be there as there is typically one HR person per city.  On a typical project you are interviewed by the client and TCS will push for you to be put onto the project.  The downside is that a lot of the time the project you interview for is not part of your skill set at all, but TCS requires you to interview anyway.  If you happen to be put onto the project you're expected to dive in head first and it is difficult when you do not know how to do what they want.  The other side is that depending on which client you go to, you are put on a six week trial or probation period in which you are considered a freebie and you will sit and do nothing or be given everything in the world with someone watching you behind your back (literally).  After the six weeks they will choose to either keep you or take you off the project.  It looks bad  on TCS if you are taken off a project, and it makes it difficult for them to put you on a new one with the same client.  This causes problems especially if you are a fresher (new person to TCS).  The longer you're on a project the more chances that you have to advance and get a raise in salary, except that you're graded, and if you happen to have a short ", "<span class=\"cmp-review-text\"> project or are removed from a project your rating drops and it becomes difficult to do anything and this is what typically happens to everyone unless you are lucky enough to become a manager.  When you're finished with a project you are generally put on the bench to await a new round of interviews that will possibly put you on a new project.  If they are unable to get you on a project they will keep you on the bench, fire you, or require you to move across the country will little to no warning and not help you in moving costs except to break a lease within a certain limit.  An example of this would be requiring a person who lives in Houston to be in Chicago by Monday or be terminated and given a one day notice.

After a tedious analysis it was found that the wrong charge that was present in users last bill has been adjusted, but in the front end View (validation added last release System change) instead of deducting the un-billed adjustment System is adding the value with last bill amount, which is going way beyond User's Credit limit and system is not allowing to suspend until a minimum amount of payment, even though He actually does not need to pay the amount as the charge has been adjusted.
