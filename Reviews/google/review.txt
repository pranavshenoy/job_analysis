The most enjoyable part of the was being outside and interacting with different people everyday. ", " There is a strong divide between working as a contractor for Google vs being an employee. It was like being at the fence of the garden of Eden, looking in at happy Googlers, while sitting just out of reach. Being a Google employee, a \"white badger\", is great. Being a contractor (or TVC as Google calls us) can range from honestly very great, to terrible. If you're a developer who is a contractor, or a manager, life is pretty good. But if you're a worker bee, it's rough. The maps people possibly have the worst of it.  The Google divide is becomes quickly, starkly obvious just after starting. There is no health insurance, and no paid time off when working as a Google Maps surveyor (or any TVC). Traveling extensively, often no where interesting, and staying over the weekend with no option to return home for weeks at a time made this job very hard for me, especially because I have a family. Vacations, even short ones, where highly detrimental to putting food on the table and paying rent.  Google gave me a corporate credit card to pay for daily meals, which was good. BUT the card was heavily micromanaged with daily and weekly reports due for its use. Even though it had a daily expenditure cap. But I was never allowed to gain points for purchases, while my managers quickly become diamond Hilton members making reservations for me... A very clear double standard. You are also expected to enter business spaces and survey but without permission from business and business owners, which didn't sit well with me.   It was also falsely advertised as 50-75% travel, but was actually closer ", "<span class=\"cmp-review-text\"> to 92.5 percent travel. I counted the days I spent with my wife, I spent about 35 days with her over a year. When I asked about this, I was informed the nature of the work changed since I was hired, and I could quit or continue working. (The nature hadn't changed, it was like that from day 1.)  It was very easy to be fired. Once, this is true, a surveyor accidentally bumped into a Google employee while passing the employee in a hallway. That TVC was fired within ten minutes, because the employee thought it was done on purpose. Another TVC made a joke an employee didn't like, and security literally showed up and escorted that person to their hotel, packed their bags, and brought them to the airport. TVC are constantly criticized my Google managers and TVC managers on the quality of their work. Any dip in \"numbers and metrics\" usually foreshadowed a reprimand. So a lot of TVC falsified their work to have high numbers, which made honest employees look like slackers. But the \"top performers\" where not questioned. This really caused a toxic work environment.   Management rarely reached out except to criticize, and frankly couldn't remember TVC names most of the time.  Performance reviews were strange. Many questions were asked, but one question was always asked. Managers constantly asked TVCs is they were \"happy\", which everyone automatically answered \"yes\", regardless of the honest of that. Google has a strange was of equating \"happiness\" to \"job performance\". While it's true happy employees work better, that doesn't mean honestly unhappy ones aren't working well. But everyone who admitted to being \"unhappy\" was let go within a month or two.  Fellow TVCs are delusional. Many TVC claim to be Google employees, but become notably distressed when unable to attend Google events, and TVC managers are vindictive when other TVC point out that \"we are all TVCs.\" Many falsely claim to be Google employees on their linkedin profiles. When the job is particularly bad, TVC offer each other reassurance that \"at least they can put Google on their resume\", which is just sad.   Google managers are removed from the TVC reality. When going to Brazil, I requested emergency medical supplies, which was denied, because Brazil \"wasn't a safety concern according to the Google Security Team.\" While sitting at gunpoint, briefly hostage in a favela, I was relieved that I purchased the kit myself. When we finally notified our Google manager of our near death experience, his response was, \"I'm in meetings all day, sounds like you guys are alive and took care of it.\"  Not having insurance become a big problem too. Due to the laws of probability, I was put in several situations where people tried to actually murder me, either through vehicular homicide while driving, and once at gun point. All in less than a year. Being a combat veteran myself, having some one trying to kill me isn't new. What was new was having zero safety net for my family should I die. And having fellow Americans (or in some cases, Brazilians) trying to kill me.  There was zero protection for women. Several of the female surveyors were nearly sexually assaulted or robbed when working in bad areas. All surveyors are put in situations of questionable safety, but being female seemed to attract even more than usual trouble.  Overall, between the micromanagement, danger, and time away from home, this was a miserable job. I don't recommend it.  If health and life insurance, and paid time off were part of the job, it would have been a better. ", " The job is loaded with great perks, but it's very high stress.

I learned how to lead a team and plan a successful work day, as well as input my previous experiences from other jobs into this one which helped me excel into the position I am currently in.    Job Description:  Google Express is a same day delivery service that caters to stores such as Target, Walgreens, Costco, and other retailers.  The area of Google Express that I work in is in the warehouse where drivers pick up customer orders (parcels) and brings them to the warehouse to be sorted, stowed, picked and given to courier drivers to be delivered.  Typical Day:  I would help open the warehouse we work in and take attendance of operators within the shift.  I would then obtain the assets needed for a successful work day i.e smartphones, barcode scanners and laptop computers.  As soon as I complete that, I assign operators to each of the three work zones: Inbound, Outbound and Prep &amp; Stow based on each individual's physical abilities as well computer knowledge and abilities to carry out tasks required.  Throughout the day,  I would monitor, as well as help any zone that need back up during our rushes.  I mostly supervise the operators and solve any problems that arise as well as guide them in the right direction and train them along the way.  Management:  I have had dealings with several managers throughout my time on the project and they all have one thing in common:  micromanaging.  In my opinion, a leader is one who joins their workers ", "<span class=\"cmp-review-text\"> throughout the day.  A leader is one who does the same work as an operator when they have the opportunity.  It is understandable that managers have their own duties but it is illogical for a manager to tell their workers how to accomplish a specific task or take on a new role without engulfing themselves within the role.    Co-Workers:  I work with a special group of operators that come to work with great attitudes and are always ready to learn new things.    Hardest part of the job:  I don't think there is a hard part of the job.  A job is only as hard as the worker makes it out to be.  Most enjoyable part:  Coming to work with the people that make the job fun and knowing that volume increases due to customers' satisfaction with the Google Express service.

What makes Google fantastic are the people, who are some of the smartest and most interesting you will encounter. However, job satisfaction depends largely on the team that you are in and the management that you are under. Some teams, such as Sales or Acquisitions, have a great deal of mindless administrative work which can be very frustrating. Also work-life balance in Sales is poor, and the wages are not high enough to compensate for this. There is a lot of top-down initiative pushing and revenue pressure, and morale can be quite low as a result. Engineering/Product Management on the other hand seems to be the \"sexiest jobs alive\" at Google. These jobs are very hard to get however, and it helps to have a contact within the firm to be referred. ", " Google had to be one of the most positive experiences that I have encountered.

The caliber of the people there is super-high, the resources and data available are unmatched, and the problems are challenging and meaningful. While I was there, I felt like a valued employee by my team and the company as a whole. The culture of openness was impressive and changed my views on how a company should be run.  That said, it's not for everyone and the Google of today is not the same as the early 2000's. It has \"grown up\" and lost a lot of the playfulness and deliberate wanderlust that made the company and the brand so powerful and successful. It will continue to be an important place with great opportunities for learning and growth, but those looking for the impact and ownership of a startup should look elsewhere. ", " The company is not as intimidating as some expect. The work is fast-paced and the metrics are clear. This company rewards hard workers who want to add to the company's ongoing goals of success. ", " I worked in the Google HR team so I can really only speak about that group. Google hires lots contractors for their HR function, and they know how to onboard them quickly and easily. With all the benefits, and amenities at their work sites I rank them as a top place to work.  They have a ton of really smart people there and no matter your role, you will learn stuff from the people around you. For this reason alone, it is a great place to work. The down side is the work/life balance. Google pushes a ton of work onto your plate and they mange to complete it. Plan on eating at work at least 4 nights a week to finish your work.  But hey, on the upside the meals are gourmet and they are free. ", " I loved my time at Google. I started as an engineer in the New York office and was there for 3 years, during which time I became a Tech Lead then a Manager responsible for multiple teams. I then worked in the Santa Monica office for a year and a half, also as a tech lead and manger. I only left Google because I wanted to move back to my home town. I really enjoyed the culture of the company, the people I worked with, and the opportunities I had to learn and grow. It was also exciting to be on the front lines of the evolution of the web. Yes, as the company got bigger there were more politics to deal with, but as of 2008, I still really loved the company and was sad to go.
