', ' Same as that is for Nordstrom Production Support - Nearshore ', ' Job consisted of routine surveillance (both physical and CCTV), weekly department audits and creating strong relationships with both employees and management. Nordstrom creates an amazing work environment which is relaxed and objective. Rapidly expanding company with plenty of opportunity for growth and promotion, but not within the store which I worked at. Management within the Loss Prevention department created a difficult work experience via scheduling and negligence in training agents to become "released". Training process was not catered towards the individual which caused a lapse in training. ', ' Nordstrom is a great company, has room for growth and also a good starting job for any one interested in retail! working for the company i have learned how to work with others and take that experience to the next level of coaching others in the role ahead. one awesome fact is they make it easy to transfer across america and stay with the company! when it comes to management at Nordstrom there is a little brushing up to do, across the bored equality and appreciation everything the employee brings to the company.

Being at the EBAR it is impossible to get the opportunity to move up because the management would rather hire externally, than from the group of employees that already work there.

With that being said there is no structure for moving up within the company and you get different answers or the run around when asking for help. When I first started with the company no one explained about the benefits or where to go to find answers so I was in the dark a lot. The employees I work with are fun and I enjoy seeing them every day, however there are clicks within the company and a lot of gossip.

My schedule would say 11:30 but I NEVER left on time, most of the time I would leave at around 1PM because we were either understaffed or doing unnecessary tasks that put us behind schedule. Literally, all of my coworkers (whom I loved dearly) on the stock team left before I did because our managers never really treated us with respect and hardly gave us recognition. We got put down more than anything. Personally, I was degraded by my managers and they weren\'t the most understanding people when it came to personal issues. If I asked a question about the work, I would get smart or sarcastic responses as if I was stupid for asking.

Retail is long hours, and what is frustrating is the fact that Nordstrom's policy allows basically anything to be returned no questions asked, so your sales numbers go up and down frequently. The sales goals are also very high. The employee discount is alright but nothing great.

Being at the EBAR it is impossible to get the opportunity to move up because the management would rather hire externally, than from the group of employees that already work there.

Its a culture that revolves around a means well, dresses well type of hierarchy, but lacks actual character. The most enjoyable thing about working at the Rack was being surrounded by the products coming in, and out of the stores, also building close knit relationships with fellow sales associates, since we had opened with that same store. Soon after opening the store, I became more aware of the culture and how management wasn't stable in keeping a reliable person in charge. I strongly felt that as a sales associate for this company it was a great title to have but short lived compared to the reality, of the culture.

They're trying to be a software company, and failing miserably. They are constantly shaking up management trying to get someone in who can deliver results in a time-frame expected by retail people (which is far to short for software development), and when it doesn't work they bring in new management. They are *far* more concerned about making sure your working hard than doing the right thing. And although they have good salary and benefits, the work environment is stifling (no walls anywhere, tiny desks, no privacy, and they're constantly re-arranging the layout of the floors). There's also only coffee to drink (not even any real creamer), and you have to pay to get anything else out of vending machines.

This manager takes pride in throwing around the title of being manager, instead of focusing on getting the department in order. The company baited me in based on lies.

They're trying to be a software company, and failing miserably. They are constantly shaking up management trying to get someone in who can deliver results in a time-frame expected by retail people (which is far to short for software development), and when it doesn't work they bring in new management. They are *far* more concerned about making sure your working hard than doing the right thing. And although they have good salary and benefits, the work environment is stifling (no walls anywhere, tiny desks, no privacy, and they're constantly re-arranging the layout of the floors). There's also only coffee to drink (not even any real creamer), and you have to pay to get anything else out of vending machines. ", " Overall Nordstrom is a fantastic place to work at. The culture is why people will stay a lifetime. Your customers and coworkers become family and are the inspiration to keep you motivated to always be better. The policies and upper management encourage your own critical thinking and problem solving to make the business your own. Of course there is stress and emotions when you work alongside commission and metric based roles ... it can take a lot out of your creativity and motivation. Isn't that most jobs? ", ' Nordstrom I can tell strives to hire people who are easy going and are open minded to working with a range of diverse groups. The one thing I love about working at Nordstrom is how diverse it is and how different departments still mingle together.  I currently work at the EBAR, so it is a little bit different than a traditional job at Nordstrom. Being at the EBAR it is impossible to get the opportunity to move up because the management would rather hire externally, than from the group of employees that already work there.

The structure of command is an inverted pyramid which shows that Customers are what keep the company alive and the employees on the front line, at the store level are most important. With that being said there is no structure for moving up within the company and you get different answers or the run around when asking for help. When I first started with the company no one explained about the benefits or where to go to find answers so I was in the dark a lot. The employees I work with are fun and I enjoy seeing them every day, however there are clicks within the company and a lot of gossip. I enjoyed wearing what I wanted to work and being able to adjust my hours to get off earlier. Everyone is positive and a team player. The technology they use, for example direct deposit comes in 3 days after your payday, is behind. ', " As a company, Nordstrom is a great company to work for. I've been fortunate enough to work with amazing people across many aspects of the company. Their employees are the number one thing the company has going for it.

I worked in both Accessories and Service Experience. I liked being on the floor and assisting people with making selections or giving advice on what would be better for them. But in Service experience, I liked having the constant interaction with customers while checking them out. Yes there were challenges, but overall, it was great working with other individuals who were goal driven and encouraging.

My schedule would say 11:30 but I NEVER left on time, most of the time I would leave at around 1PM because we were either understaffed or doing unnecessary tasks that put us behind schedule. Literally, all of my coworkers (whom I loved dearly) on the stock team left before I did because our managers never really treated us with respect and hardly gave us recognition. We got put down more than anything. Personally, I was degraded by my managers and they weren\'t the most understanding people when it came to personal issues. If I asked a question about the work, I would get smart or sarcastic responses as if I was stupid for asking. They boast this "open door policy" and when my coworkers took advantage of this benefit and spoke up about issues going on, things were peachy for about 3 days and then back to the same ol\'.

I believe the reason behind my love for Nordstrom is the culture i enjoy fashion so i truly enjoy the life balance i achieved from working around and under leaders who believed in acknowledging you not only as an individual but as a team. My everyday goals here were to just be the best me i can be and let that shine to the customer. Which i was empowered to do each day. The area for advancement was also huge. I love to be rewarded for my good/ hard work and sometimes we were rewarded so much i began to wonder was i truly working this hard or did this company just enjoy taking care of its customers. This will forever and always be my favorite place to have worked. ', " Nordstrom is a great company for EVERYONE. If you're a student looking a for extra money or if you're seeking a career with growth opportunities, Nordstrom has a place and position for you. I am so blessed to be apart of a company that feels like family. They are quick to take care of their employees just as quickly as they take care of their customers. I never feel like I don't have a voice. Also, because they have so many locations including their Rack division, opportunities exist all over the country and now in Canada as well.  I've always felt well compensated since day one and the benefits have continued to grow in my almost 4 years with the company. I'm grateful. ", " The company has great ideas, and the direction it wants to go is good for their clients. Its a culture that revolves around a means well, dresses well type of hierarchy, but lacks actual character. The most enjoyable thing about working at the Rack was being surrounded by the products coming in, and out of the stores, also building close knit relationships with fellow sales associates, since we had opened with that same store. Soon after opening the store, I became more aware of the culture and how management wasn't stable in keeping a reliable person in charge. I strongly felt that as a sales associate for this company it was a great title to have but short lived compared to the reality, of the culture. I also did not want to grow with a company that seemed to change the people who are so indebted to the cause, that their ethics, and morals become distorted, and they treat workers down the cycle less than. ", ' Nordstrom is a great corporation because they are committed to promoting talent from within and ensuring career advancement to top performers. Retail commission based sales positions are great for college students who need part time jobs that offer autonomy, flexible schedules, and a competitive and fast paced work environment, and Nordstrom is no exception! ', " To be fair, this is the experience of a software developer, not someone in retail, so the perspective isn't the same for all of Nordstrom. They're trying to be a software company, and failing miserably. They are constantly shaking up management trying to get someone in who can deliver results in a time-frame expected by retail people (which is far to short for software development), and when it doesn't work they bring in new management. They are *far* more concerned about making sure your working hard than doing the right thing. And although they have good salary and benefits, the work environment is stifling (no walls anywhere, tiny desks, no privacy, and they're constantly re-arranging the layout of the floors). There's also only coffee to drink (not even any real creamer), and you have to pay to get anything else out of vending machines. ", ' Nordstrom is a great company to work for as far as management and employees go, however, there are very low chances of growing into a management role or it would take too long. It is not a place for people who wants to have a solid career. But if you have time and looking into making extra cash, it is better than most retailers.

My schedule would say 11:30 but I NEVER left on time, most of the time I would leave at around 1PM because we were either understaffed or doing unnecessary tasks that put us behind schedule. Literally, all of my coworkers (whom I loved dearly) on the stock team left before I did because our managers never really treated us with respect and hardly gave us recognition. We got put down more than anything. Personally, I was degraded by my managers and they weren\'t the most understanding people when it came to personal issues. If I asked a question about the work, I would get smart or sarcastic responses as if I was stupid for asking. They boast this "open door policy" and when my coworkers took advantage of this benefit and spoke up about issues going on, things were peachy for about 3 days and then back to the same ol\'.

Once store was open we would start following up with any customers that needed to be taken care of as well as reaching out to new customers to set appointments for styling.

One of the greatest things I have learned so far is to give a great customer service experience to every person and customer that comes inside the store. On the other hand they have a really good communication openness between managers and employees.

I personally believe that better management needs to be adjusted as well as better training. Workplace culture can be stressful but one should definitely learn to not let everything bother them.

Nordstrom was a fast paced work environment that you meet people everyday .I can say that there this work place was diverse .

', ' Same as that is for Nordstrom Production Support - Nearshore ', ' Job consisted of routine surveillance (both physical and CCTV), weekly department audits and creating strong relationships with both employees and management. Nordstrom creates an amazing work environment which is relaxed and objective. Rapidly expanding company with plenty of opportunity for growth and promotion, but not within the store which I worked at. Management within the Loss Prevention department created a difficult work experience via scheduling and negligence in training agents to become "released". Training process was not catered towards the individual which caused a lapse in training. ', ' Nordstrom is a great company, has room for growth and also a good starting job for any one interested in retail! working for the company i have learned how to work with others and take that experience to the next level of coaching others in the role ahead. one awesome fact is they make it easy to transfer across america and stay with the company! when it comes to management at Nordstrom there is a little brushing up to do, across the bored equality and appreciation everything the employee brings to the company. The hardest part of the job for me was the scheduling, effecting structure in your outside life and the work overload in some locations. Last but not least the most enjoyable part depending on location, the team work involved every day to drive numbers and always putting the customer first! ', " Nordstrom is a great company for EVERYONE. If you're a student looking a for extra money or if you're seeking a career with growth opportunities, Nordstrom has a place and position for you. I am so blessed to be apart of a company that feels like family. They are quick to take care of their employees just as quickly as they take care of their customers. I never feel like I don't have a voice. Also, because they have so many locations including their Rack division, opportunities exist all over the country and now in Canada as well.  I've always felt well compensated since day one and the benefits have continued to grow in my almost 4 years with the company. I'm grateful. ", " A typical day at Nordstrom is horrible. The managers that they hire for the position are not manger material. They do not listen to their employees unless you are friend , or if they like you.The mangers work you like crazy. My manger will give me eight tasks to do and it has to be completed by the end of my shift. My manger is not well organize and she does not know how to manage at all. T The co-workers are extremely nice. I haven't had any problems with my co-workers. It is not the best company to work for. ", " To be fair, this is the experience of a software developer, not someone in retail, so the perspective isn't the same for all of Nordstrom. They're trying to be a software company, and failing miserably. They are constantly shaking up management trying to get someone in who can deliver results in a time-frame expected by retail people (which is far to short for software development), and when it doesn't work they bring in new management. They are *far* more concerned about making sure your working hard than doing the right thing. And although they have good salary and benefits, the work environment is stifling (no walls anywhere, tiny desks, no privacy, and they're constantly re-arranging the layout of the floors). There's also only coffee to drink (not even any real creamer), and you have to pay to get anything else out of vending machines. ", " Overall Nordstrom is a fantastic place to work at. The culture is why people will stay a lifetime. Your customers and coworkers become family and are the inspiration to keep you motivated to always be better. The policies and upper management encourage your own critical thinking and problem solving to make the business your own. Of course there is stress and emotions when you work alongside commission and metric based roles ... it can take a lot out of your creativity and motivation. Isn't that most jobs? ", ' Nordstrom I can tell strives to hire people who are easy going and are open minded to working with a range of diverse groups. The one thing I love about working at Nordstrom is how diverse it is and how different departments still mingle together.  I currently work at the EBAR, so it is a little bit different than a traditional job at Nordstrom. Being at the EBAR it is impossible to get the opportunity to move up because the management would rather hire externally, than from the group of employees that already work there. This aspect would have to be the hardest part about my job.  I do enjoy making friendships and connections with the regulars that come into our coffee bar. That would be the most enjoyable part of my job. ', ' I started with Nordstrom in Dallas and it was a Dream job. Everything was perfect: management, compensation, culture, etc. I was promoted quickly and eventually wanted to try something new in a different region. I chose the NE. Bad decision. Completely different caliber of people and culture. Just terrible. It broke my fervor for the company and my career within it. Had I chose a different region I would have probably been an employee for life. ', ' Nordstrom is a great company with a strong desire to create a fantastic environment for their customers. The structure of command is an inverted pyramid which shows that Customers are what keep the company alive and the employees on the front line, at the store level are most important. With that being said there is no structure for moving up within the company and you get different answers or the run around when asking for help. When I first started with the company no one explained about the benefits or where to go to find answers so I was in the dark a lot. The employees I work with are fun and I enjoy seeing them every day, however there are clicks within the company and a lot of gossip. I enjoyed wearing what I wanted to work and being able to adjust my hours to get off earlier. Everyone is positive and a team player. The technology they use, for example direct deposit comes in 3 days after your payday, is behind. ', " As a company, Nordstrom is a great company to work for. I've been fortunate enough to work with amazing people across many aspects of the company. Their employees are the number one thing the company has going for it.  Nordstrom IT, on the other hand, is suffering at the hands of change. There is little guidance, strategy or support from management. Today's IT leadership is rudderless. They do not seem to care about their employees. Work-life balance is out of balance. ", ' I had a great time working at Nordstrom...I was actually at the Rack and I had a great time. I worked in both Accessories and Service Experience. I liked being on the floor and assisting people with making selections or giving advice on what would be better for them. But in Service experience, I liked having the constant interaction with customers while checking them out. Yes there were challenges, but overall, it was great working with other individuals who were goal driven and encouraging. ', " At first your led to believe Nordstrom really cares about their people, and wants to hear their thoughts. You quickly find out this isn't so. Management has there favorites, and in order to be seen you must kiss up. Doing your job isn't enough, your'e encouraged to NOT think out of the box. My first year there was great, because they had a more caring management team, but as time went on people left, and new management just didn't care about the family business feel they were once fostering.

Compensation, healthcare, 401K,  employee stock purchases, are good. ", ' Normal day as a stockperson is coming in at 4:30 AM and leaving whenever the manager tells you to. My schedule would say 11:30 but I NEVER left on time, most of the time I would leave at around 1PM because we were either understaffed or doing unnecessary tasks that put us behind schedule. Literally, all of my coworkers (whom I loved dearly) on the stock team left before I did because our managers never really treated us with respect and hardly gave us recognition. We got put down more than anything. Personally, I was degraded by my managers and they weren\'t the most understanding people when it came to personal issues. If I asked a question about the work, I would get smart or sarcastic responses as if I was stupid for asking. They boast this "open door policy" and when my coworkers took advantage of this benefit and spoke up about issues going on, things were peachy for about 3 days and then back to the same ol\'. The company itself is great, though! Always did things for charity, potlucks, and when times got hard for me financially, they did help.

', ' My schedule was generally  8 to 5 pm and two closing shifts per week. I would come into work and check sales from the previous day,assign goals and delegate tasks as needed. I would merchandise new product onto the floor five days per week. All product received had to be out onto the floor so we were ready for business when the store opened. Once store was open we would start following up with any customers that needed to be taken care of as well as reaching out to new customers to set appointments for styling. I would partner with the team to help sell in order to help their business as well as the departments. I learned that every person is different, you have to be able to work with that individual person, that people work for people. The reason I worked for Nordstrom was my customers and delivering great customer service. I also love to merchandise all the exciting new product. ', ' Typical day at work varied. There was alot of unorganization. Sales goals could be unattainable given the current seasons. I did learn about products and their uses. Management varied. Alot of politics involved.

One of the greatest things I have learned so far is to give a great customer service experience to every person and customer that comes inside the store. On the other hand they have a really good communication openness between managers and employees. ', " A typical day at Nordstrom would include fulfilling all requested orders, maintaining stock and the available merchandise and tidying up my section. I personally believe that better management needs to be adjusted as well as better training. Workplace culture can be stressful but one should definitely learn to not let everything bother them.

Nordstrom was a fast paced work environment that you meet people everyday .I can say that there this work place was diverse .

', ' Same as that is for Nordstrom Production Support - Nearshore ', ' Job consisted of routine surveillance (both physical and CCTV), weekly department audits and creating strong relationships with both employees and management. Nordstrom creates an amazing work environment which is relaxed and objective. Rapidly expanding company with plenty of opportunity for growth and promotion, but not within the store which I worked at. Management within the Loss Prevention department created a difficult work experience via scheduling and negligence in training agents to become "released". Training process was not catered towards the individual which caused a lapse in training. ', " Nordstrom will take you through a series of lessons and education about the position. Management is pretty encouraging &amp; respectful. However, being that everyone is on high commission, its a pretty competitive environment. There are certain employees who will be very competitive and will do anything to sell the most. Retail is long hours, and what is frustrating is the fact that Nordstrom's policy allows basically anything to be returned no questions asked, so your sales numbers go up and down frequently. The sales goals are also very high. The employee discount is alright but nothing great. It really comes down to how competitive of a sales person you are and if you enjoy the retail commission atmosphere. ", ' Nordstrom is a great company, has room for growth and also a good starting job for any one interested in retail! working for the company i have learned how to work with others and take that experience to the next level of coaching others in the role ahead. one awesome fact is they make it easy to transfer across america and stay with the company! when it comes to management at Nordstrom there is a little brushing up to do, across the bored equality and appreciation everything the employee brings to the company. The hardest part of the job for me was the scheduling, effecting structure in your outside life and the work overload in some locations. Last but not least the most enjoyable part depending on location, the team work involved every day to drive numbers and always putting the customer first! ', ' I started with Nordstrom in Dallas and it was a Dream job. Everything was perfect: management, compensation, culture, etc. I was promoted quickly and eventually wanted to try something new in a different region. I chose the NE. Bad decision. Completely different caliber of people and culture. Just terrible. It broke my fervor for the company and my career within it. Had I chose a different region I would have probably been an employee for life. ', " Overall Nordstrom is a fantastic place to work at. The culture is why people will stay a lifetime. Your customers and coworkers become family and are the inspiration to keep you motivated to always be better. The policies and upper management encourage your own critical thinking and problem solving to make the business your own. Of course there is stress and emotions when you work alongside commission and metric based roles ... it can take a lot out of your creativity and motivation. Isn't that most jobs? ", ' Nordstrom I can tell strives to hire people who are easy going and are open minded to working with a range of diverse groups. The one thing I love about working at Nordstrom is how diverse it is and how different departments still mingle together.  I currently work at the EBAR, so it is a little bit different than a traditional job at Nordstrom. Being at the EBAR it is impossible to get the opportunity to move up because the management would rather hire externally, than from the group of employees that already work there. This aspect would have to be the hardest part about my job.  I do enjoy making friendships and connections with the regulars that come into our coffee bar. That would be the most enjoyable part of my job. ', " A typical day at Nordstrom is horrible. The managers that they hire for the position are not manger material. They do not listen to their employees unless you are friend , or if they like you.The mangers work you like crazy. My manger will give me eight tasks to do and it has to be completed by the end of my shift. My manger is not well organize and she does not know how to manage at all. T The co-workers are extremely nice. I haven't had any problems with my co-workers. It is not the best company to work for. ", " Nordstrom is a very established premium retail company based in Seattle Washington.   Very open and friendly workplace with  room for advancement depending on one's desires and abilities.   Compensation, healthcare, 401K,  employee stock purchases, are good. ", ' Typical day at work varied. There was alot of unorganization. Sales goals could be unattainable given the current seasons. I did learn about products and their uses. Management varied. Alot of politics involved. Promotions arent based on numbers and a persons sales. My coworkers were pleasant for trh most part. There is no job security. Benefits can be taken away at any given time for lack of hours but schedule is done "based on business". Not ideal for a person with real bills. The most enjoyable part of the job was constantly excersing my craft. ', ' Nordstrom is a great place to work, especially as a starter job. They pay very well, and make you feel valuable. If retail is not your long term goal, I do not suggest falling in love with the company or you will find yourself for many years, and wondering where the time went. It is a great job to have while in school because they will work with your schedule regardless of how few hours you wish to work. ', " As a company, Nordstrom is a great company to work for. I've been fortunate enough to work with amazing people across many aspects of the company. Their employees are the number one thing the company has going for it.  Nordstrom IT, on the other hand, is suffering at the hands of change. There is little guidance, strategy or support from management. Today's IT leadership is rudderless. They do not seem to care about their employees. Work-life balance is out of balance. ", ' Nordstrom has and will always be my favorite place to work. I took so many lessons from working here, not just work lessons but life lessons. I believe the reason behind my love for Nordstrom is the culture i enjoy fashion so i truly enjoy the life balance i achieved from working around and under leaders who believed in acknowledging you not only as an individual but as a team. My everyday goals here were to just be the best me i can be and let that shine to the customer. Which i was empowered to do each day. The area for advancement was also huge. I love to be rewarded for my good/ hard work and sometimes we were rewarded so much i began to wonder was i truly working this hard or did this company just enjoy taking care of its customers. This will forever and always be my favorite place to have worked. ', " Nordstrom is a great company for EVERYONE. If you're a student looking a for extra money or if you're seeking a career with growth opportunities, Nordstrom has a place and position for you. I am so blessed to be apart of a company that feels like family. They are quick to take care of their employees just as quickly as they take care of their customers. I never feel like I don't have a voice. Also, because they have so many locations including their Rack division, opportunities exist all over the country and now in Canada as well.  I've always felt well compensated since day one and the benefits have continued to grow in my almost 4 years with the company. I'm grateful. ", " The company has great ideas, and the direction it wants to go is good for their clients. Its a culture that revolves around a means well, dresses well type of hierarchy, but lacks actual character. The most enjoyable thing about working at the Rack was being surrounded by the products coming in, and out of the stores, also building close knit relationships with fellow sales associates, since we had opened with that same store. Soon after opening the store, I became more aware of the culture and how management wasn't stable in keeping a reliable person in charge. I strongly felt that as a sales associate for this company it was a great title to have but short lived compared to the reality, of the culture. I also did not want to grow with a company that seemed to change the people who are so indebted to the cause, that their ethics, and morals become distorted, and they treat workers down the cycle less than. ", ' Nordstrom is a great corporation because they are committed to promoting talent from within and ensuring career advancement to top performers. Retail commission based sales positions are great for college students who need part time jobs that offer autonomy, flexible schedules, and a competitive and fast paced work environment, and Nordstrom is no exception! ', " To be fair, this is the experience of a software developer, not someone in retail, so the perspective isn't the same for all of Nordstrom. They're trying to be a software company, and failing miserably. They are constantly shaking up management trying to get someone in who can deliver results in a time-frame expected by retail people (which is far to short for software development), and when it doesn't work they bring in new management. They are *far* more concerned about making sure your working hard than doing the right thing. And although they have good salary and benefits, the work environment is stifling (no walls anywhere, tiny desks, no privacy, and they're constantly re-arranging the layout of the floors). There's also only coffee to drink (not even any real creamer), and you have to pay to get anything else out of vending machines. ", ' Nordstrom is a great company to work for as far as management and employees go, however, there are very low chances of growing into a management role or it would take too long. It is not a place for people who wants to have a solid career. But if you have time and looking into making extra cash, it is better than most retailers.

They're trying to be a software company, and failing miserably. They are constantly shaking up management trying to get someone in who can deliver results in a time-frame expected by retail people (which is far to short for software development), and when it doesn't work they bring in new management. They are *far* more concerned about making sure your working hard than doing the right thing. And although they have good salary and benefits, the work environment is stifling (no walls anywhere, tiny desks, no privacy, and they're constantly re-arranging the layout of the floors). There's also only coffee to drink (not even any real creamer), and you have to pay to get anything else out of vending machines. ", " Overall Nordstrom is a fantastic place to work at.

The one thing I love about working at Nordstrom is how diverse it is and how different departments still mingle together.  I currently work at the EBAR, so it is a little bit different than a traditional job at Nordstrom. Being at the EBAR it is impossible to get the opportunity to move up because the management would rather hire externally, than from the group of employees that already work there. This aspect would have to be the hardest part about my job.  I do enjoy making friendships and connections with the regulars that come into our coffee bar.

The structure of command is an inverted pyramid which shows that Customers are what keep the company alive and the employees on the front line, at the store level are most important. With that being said there is no structure for moving up within the company and you get different answers or the run around when asking for help. When I first started with the company no one explained about the benefits or where to go to find answers so I was in the dark a lot. The employees I work with are fun and I enjoy seeing them every day, however there are clicks within the company and a lot of gossip. I enjoyed wearing what I wanted to work and being able to adjust my hours to get off earlier. Everyone is positive and a team player.

I've been fortunate enough to work with amazing people across many aspects of the company. Their employees are the number one thing the company has going for it.

Yes there were challenges, but overall, it was great working with other individuals who were goal driven and encouraging.

My schedule would say 11:30 but I NEVER left on time, most of the time I would leave at around 1PM because we were either understaffed or doing unnecessary tasks that put us behind schedule. Literally, all of my coworkers (whom I loved dearly) on the stock team left before I did because our managers never really treated us with respect and hardly gave us recognition. We got put down more than anything. Personally, I was degraded by my managers and they weren\'t the most understanding people when it came to personal issues. If I asked a question about the work, I would get smart or sarcastic responses as if I was stupid for asking. They boast this "open door policy" and when my coworkers took advantage of this benefit and spoke up about issues going on, things were peachy for about 3 days and then back to the same ol\'.

', ' Same as that is for Nordstrom Production Support - Nearshore ', ' Job consisted of routine surveillance (both physical and CCTV), weekly department audits and creating strong relationships with both employees and management. Nordstrom creates an amazing work environment which is relaxed and objective. Rapidly expanding company with plenty of opportunity for growth and promotion, but not within the store which I worked at. Management within the Loss Prevention department created a difficult work experience via scheduling and negligence in training agents to become "released". Training process was not catered towards the individual which caused a lapse in training.

The hardest part of the job for me was the scheduling, effecting structure in your outside life and the work overload in some locations. Last but not least the most enjoyable part depending on location, the team work involved every day to drive numbers and always putting the customer first!

I am so blessed to be apart of a company that feels like family. They are quick to take care of their employees just as quickly as they take care of their customers. I never feel like I don't have a voice. Also, because they have so many locations including their Rack division, opportunities exist all over the country and now in Canada as well.  I've always felt well compensated since day one and the benefits have continued to grow in my almost 4 years with the company. I'm grateful. ", " A typical day at Nordstrom is horrible. The managers that they hire for the position are not manger material. They do not listen to their employees unless you are friend , or if they like you.The mangers work you like crazy. My manger will give me eight tasks to do and it has to be completed by the end of my shift. My manger is not well organize and she does not know how to manage at all. T The co-workers are extremely nice. I haven't had any problems with my co-workers. It is not the best company to work for. ", " To be fair, this is the experience of a software developer, not someone in retail, so the perspective isn't the same for all of Nordstrom. They're trying to be a software company, and failing miserably. They are constantly shaking up management trying to get someone in who can deliver results in a time-frame expected by retail people (which is far to short for software development), and when it doesn't work they bring in new management. They are *far* more concerned about making sure your working hard than doing the right thing. And although they have good salary and benefits, the work environment is stifling (no walls anywhere, tiny desks, no privacy, and they're constantly re-arranging the layout of the floors). There's also only coffee to drink (not even any real creamer), and you have to pay to get anything else out of vending machines. ", " Overall Nordstrom is a fantastic place to work at. The culture is why people will stay a lifetime. Your customers and coworkers become family and are the inspiration to keep you motivated to always be better. The policies and upper management encourage your own critical thinking and problem solving to make the business your own. Of course there is stress and emotions when you work alongside commission and metric based roles ... it can take a lot out of your creativity and motivation. Isn't that most jobs? ", ' Nordstrom I can tell strives to hire people who are easy going and are open minded to working with a range of diverse groups. The one thing I love about working at Nordstrom is how diverse it is and how different departments still mingle together.  I currently work at the EBAR, so it is a little bit different than a traditional job at Nordstrom. Being at the EBAR it is impossible to get the opportunity to move up because the management would rather hire externally, than from the group of employees that already work there. This aspect would have to be the hardest part about my job.  I do enjoy making friendships and connections with the regulars that come into our coffee bar. That would be the most enjoyable part of my job. ', ' I started with Nordstrom in Dallas and it was a Dream job. Everything was perfect: management, compensation, culture, etc. I was promoted quickly and eventually wanted to try something new in a different region. I chose the NE. Bad decision. Completely different caliber of people and culture. Just terrible. It broke my fervor for the company and my career within it. Had I chose a different region I would have probably been an employee for life. ', ' Nordstrom is a great company with a strong desire to create a fantastic environment for their customers. The structure of command is an inverted pyramid which shows that Customers are what keep the company alive and the employees on the front line, at the store level are most important. With that being said there is no structure for moving up within the company and you get different answers or the run around when asking for help. When I first started with the company no one explained about the benefits or where to go to find answers so I was in the dark a lot. The employees I work with are fun and I enjoy seeing them every day, however there are clicks within the company and a lot of gossip. I enjoyed wearing what I wanted to work and being able to adjust my hours to get off earlier. Everyone is positive and a team player. The technology they use, for example direct deposit comes in 3 days after your payday, is behind. ', " As a company, Nordstrom is a great company to work for. I've been fortunate enough to work with amazing people across many aspects of the company. Their employees are the number one thing the company has going for it.  Nordstrom IT, on the other hand, is suffering at the hands of change. There is little guidance, strategy or support from management. Today's IT leadership is rudderless. They do not seem to care about their employees. Work-life balance is out of balance. ", ' I had a great time working at Nordstrom...I was actually at the Rack and I had a great time. I worked in both Accessories and Service Experience. I liked being on the floor and assisting people with making selections or giving advice on what would be better for them. But in Service experience, I liked having the constant interaction with customers while checking them out. Yes there were challenges, but overall, it was great working with other individuals who were goal driven and encouraging. ', " At first your led to believe Nordstrom really cares about their people, and wants to hear their thoughts. You quickly find out this isn't so. Management has there favorites, and in order to be seen you must kiss up. Doing your job isn't enough, your'e encouraged to NOT think out of the box. My first year there was great, because they had a more caring management team, but as time went on people left, and new management just didn't care about the family business feel they were once fostering. ", ' Nordstrom is a great place to work, especially as a starter job. They pay very well, and make you feel valuable. If retail is not your long term goal, I do not suggest falling in love with the company or you will find yourself for many years, and wondering where the time went. It is a great job to have while in school because they will work with your schedule regardless of how few hours you wish to work. ', " Nordstrom is a very established premium retail company based in Seattle Washington.   Very open and friendly workplace with  room for advancement depending on one's desires and abilities.   Compensation, healthcare, 401K,  employee stock purchases, are good. ", ' Normal day as a stockperson is coming in at 4:30 AM and leaving whenever the manager tells you to. My schedule would say 11:30 but I NEVER left on time, most of the time I would leave at around 1PM because we were either understaffed or doing unnecessary tasks that put us behind schedule. Literally, all of my coworkers (whom I loved dearly) on the stock team left before I did because our managers never really treated us with respect and hardly gave us recognition. We got put down more than anything. Personally, I was degraded by my managers and they weren\'t the most understanding people when it came to personal issues. If I asked a question about the work, I would get smart or sarcastic responses as if I was stupid for asking. They boast this "open door policy" and when my coworkers took advantage of this benefit and spoke up about issues going on, things were peachy for about 3 days and then back to the same ol\'. The company itself is great, though! Always did things for charity, potlucks, and when times got hard for me financially, they did help. ', ' Nordstrom is a major retail merchandiser with a successful presence in the North American market.  It is well designed and very well managed, as you would expect.  There is a commission policy in place to encourage sales staff but the sales threshold required for the policy to be enacted make it impossible to achieve.  There is the illusion of a fair compensation policy.  Benefits other than wages are good and encourage staff retention but you cannot live in Toronto on the wages earned. ', ' My schedule was generally  8 to 5 pm and two closing shifts per week. I would come into work and check sales from the previous day,assign goals and delegate tasks as needed. I would merchandise new product onto the floor five days per week. All product received had to be out onto the floor so we were ready for business when the store opened. Once store was open we would start following up with any customers that needed to be taken care of as well as reaching out to new customers to set appointments for styling. I would partner with the team to help sell in order to help their business as well as the departments. I learned that every person is different, you have to be able to work with that individual person, that people work for people. The reason I worked for Nordstrom was my customers and delivering great customer service. I also love to merchandise all the exciting new product. ', ' Typical day at work varied. There was alot of unorganization. Sales goals could be unattainable given the current seasons. I did learn about products and their uses. Management varied. Alot of politics involved. Promotions arent based on numbers and a persons sales. My coworkers were pleasant for trh most part. There is no job security.

", ' This store opened with a lot of fanfare, but quickly fell short of expectations.  Customers were disappointed in the selections, and the lack of popular brands such as St. John, Canali, Ferragamo, and others.  They began to compare the store to Dillards and just walked across the parking lot.  The training for salespeople was hurried and as a result, the Nordstrom culture was not set in place.  In general a great disappointment to employees and customers ', " A typical day at work was getting there 15 minutes before schedule. To be able to do anything that wasn't finished the night before.

On countless occasions, I stayed more than 2 hours past my scheduled shift. At the end of the day, that wasn't good enough according to the unqualified manager they brought in. This manager takes pride in throwing around the title of being manager, instead of focusing on getting the department in order. The company baited me in based on lies.

Nordstrom creates an amazing work environment which is relaxed and objective. Rapidly expanding company with plenty of opportunity for growth and promotion, but not within the store which I worked at. Management within the Loss Prevention department created a difficult work experience via scheduling and negligence in training agents to become "released". Training process was not catered towards the individual which caused a lapse in training. ', " Nordstrom will take you through a series of lessons and education about the position. Management is pretty encouraging &amp; respectful. However, being that everyone is on high commission, its a pretty competitive environment. There are certain employees who will be very competitive and will do anything to sell the most. Retail is long hours, and what is frustrating is the fact that Nordstrom's policy allows basically anything to be returned no questions asked, so your sales numbers go up and down frequently. The sales goals are also very high. The employee discount is alright but nothing great. It really comes down to how competitive of a sales person you are and if you enjoy the retail commission atmosphere.

The hardest part of the job for me was the scheduling, effecting structure in your outside life and the work overload in some locations. Last but not least the most enjoyable part depending on location, the team work involved every day to drive numbers and always putting the customer first!

Your customers and coworkers become family and are the inspiration to keep you motivated to always be better.

", ' Nordstrom I can tell strives to hire people who are easy going and are open minded to working with a range of diverse groups. The one thing I love about working at Nordstrom is how diverse it is and how different departments still mingle together.  I currently work at the EBAR, so it is a little bit different than a traditional job at Nordstrom. Being at the EBAR it is impossible to get the opportunity to move up because the management would rather hire externally, than from the group of employees that already work there. This aspect would have to be the hardest part about my job.  I do enjoy making friendships and connections with the regulars that come into our coffee bar. That would be the most enjoyable part of my job. ', " A typical day at Nordstrom is horrible. The managers that they hire for the position are not manger material. They do not listen to their employees unless you are friend , or if they like you.The mangers work you like crazy. My manger will give me eight tasks to do and it has to be completed by the end of my shift. My manger is not well organize and she does not know how to manage at all.

I did learn about products and their uses. Management varied. Alot of politics involved. Promotions arent based on numbers and a persons sales. My coworkers were pleasant for trh most part. There is no job security. Benefits can be taken away at any given time for lack of hours but schedule is done "based on business". Not ideal for a person with real bills.

I've been fortunate enough to work with amazing people across many aspects of the company. Their employees are the number one thing the company has going for it.  Nordstrom IT, on the other hand, is suffering at the hands of change. There is little guidance, strategy or support from management. Today's IT leadership is rudderless.

Nordstrom creates an amazing work environment which is relaxed and objective. Rapidly expanding company with plenty of opportunity for growth and promotion, but not within the store which I worked at. Management within the Loss Prevention department created a difficult work experience via scheduling and negligence in training agents to become "released". Training process was not catered towards the individual which caused a lapse in training. ', " Nordstrom will take you through a series of lessons and education about the position. Management is pretty encouraging &amp; respectful. However, being that everyone is on high commission, its a pretty competitive environment. There are certain employees who will be very competitive and will do anything to sell the most. Retail is long hours, and what is frustrating is the fact that Nordstrom's policy allows basically anything to be returned no questions asked, so your sales numbers go up and down frequently. The sales goals are also very high. The employee discount is alright but nothing great. It really comes down to how competitive of a sales person you are and if you enjoy the retail commission atmosphere. ", ' Nordstrom is a great company, has room for growth and also a good starting job for any one interested in retail! working for the company i have learned how to work with others and take that experience to the next level of coaching others in the role ahead. one awesome fact is they make it easy to transfer across america and stay with the company! when it comes to management at Nordstrom there is a little brushing up to do, across the bored equality and appreciation everything the employee brings to the company. The hardest part of the job for me was the scheduling, effecting structure in your outside life and the work overload in some locations. Last but not least the most enjoyable part depending on location, the team work involved every day to drive numbers and always putting the customer first!

Everything was perfect: management, compensation, culture, etc. I was promoted quickly and eventually wanted to try something new in a different region. I chose the NE. Bad decision. Completely different caliber of people and culture. Just terrible. It broke my fervor for the company and my career within it. Had I chose a different region I would have probably been an employee for life. ', " Overall Nordstrom is a fantastic place to work at. The culture is why people will stay a lifetime. Your customers and coworkers become family and are the inspiration to keep you motivated to always be better. The policies and upper management encourage your own critical thinking and problem solving to make the business your own. Of course there is stress and emotions when you work alongside commission and metric based roles ... it can take a lot out of your creativity and motivation. Isn't that most jobs? ", ' Nordstrom I can tell strives to hire people who are easy going and are open minded to working with a range of diverse groups. The one thing I love about working at Nordstrom is how diverse it is and how different departments still mingle together.  I currently work at the EBAR, so it is a little bit different than a traditional job at Nordstrom. Being at the EBAR it is impossible to get the opportunity to move up because the management would rather hire externally, than from the group of employees that already work there. This aspect would have to be the hardest part about my job.  I do enjoy making friendships and connections with the regulars that come into our coffee bar. That would be the most enjoyable part of my job. ', " A typical day at Nordstrom is horrible. The managers that they hire for the position are not manger material. They do not listen to their employees unless you are friend , or if they like you.The mangers work you like crazy. My manger will give me eight tasks to do and it has to be completed by the end of my shift. My manger is not well organize and she does not know how to manage at all.

Compensation, healthcare, 401K,  employee stock purchases, are good. ", ' Typical day at work varied. There was alot of unorganization. Sales goals could be unattainable given the current seasons. I did learn about products and their uses. Management varied. Alot of politics involved. Promotions arent based on numbers and a persons sales. My coworkers were pleasant for trh most part. There is no job security. Benefits can be taken away at any given time for lack of hours but schedule is done "based on business". Not ideal for a person with real bills. The most enjoyable part of the job was constantly excersing my craft. ', ' Nordstrom is a great place to work, especially as a starter job. They pay very well, and make you feel valuable. If retail is not your long term goal, I do not suggest falling in love with the company or you will find yourself for many years, and wondering where the time went. It is a great job to have while in school because they will work with your schedule regardless of how few hours you wish to work. ', " As a company, Nordstrom is a great company to work for. I've been fortunate enough to work with amazing people across many aspects of the company. Their employees are the number one thing the company has going for it.

They are *far* more concerned about making sure your working hard than doing the right thing. And although they have good salary and benefits, the work environment is stifling (no walls anywhere, tiny desks, no privacy, and they're constantly re-arranging the layout of the floors).

The one thing I love about working at Nordstrom is how diverse it is and how different departments still mingle together.  I currently work at the EBAR, so it is a little bit different than a traditional job at Nordstrom. Being at the EBAR it is impossible to get the opportunity to move up because the management would rather hire externally, than from the group of employees that already work there.

That would be the most enjoyable part of my job. ', ' I started with Nordstrom in Dallas and it was a Dream job.

When I first started with the company no one explained about the benefits or where to go to find answers so I was in the dark a lot. The employees I work with are fun and I enjoy seeing them every day, however there are clicks within the company and a lot of gossip.

I worked in both Accessories and Service Experience. I liked being on the floor and assisting people with making selections or giving advice on what would be better for them.

Yes there were challenges, but overall, it was great working with other individuals who were goal driven and encouraging.

My schedule would say 11:30 but I NEVER left on time, most of the time I would leave at around 1PM because we were either understaffed or doing unnecessary tasks that put us behind schedule. Literally, all of my coworkers (whom I loved dearly) on the stock team left before I did because our managers never really treated us with respect and hardly gave us recognition. We got put down more than anything. Personally, I was degraded by my managers and they weren\'t the most understanding people when it came to personal issues. If I asked a question about the work, I would get smart or sarcastic responses as if I was stupid for asking.

Once store was open we would start following up with any customers that needed to be taken care of as well as reaching out to new customers to set appointments for styling.

The one thing I love about working at Nordstrom is how diverse it is and how different departments still mingle together.  I currently work at the EBAR, so it is a little bit different than a traditional job at Nordstrom. Being at the EBAR it is impossible to get the opportunity to move up because the management would rather hire externally, than from the group of employees that already work there.

Had I chose a different region I would have probably been an employee for life. ', ' Nordstrom is a great company with a strong desire to create a fantastic environment for their customers. The structure of command is an inverted pyramid which shows that Customers are what keep the company alive and the employees on the front line, at the store level are most important. With that being said there is no structure for moving up within the company and you get different answers or the run around when asking for help. When I first started with the company no one explained about the benefits or where to go to find answers so I was in the dark a lot. The employees I work with are fun and I enjoy seeing them every day, however there are clicks within the company and a lot of gossip. I enjoyed wearing what I wanted to work and being able to adjust my hours to get off earlier. Everyone is positive and a team player.

Yes there were challenges, but overall, it was great working with other individuals who were goal driven and encouraging.

My schedule would say 11:30 but I NEVER left on time, most of the time I would leave at around 1PM because we were either understaffed or doing unnecessary tasks that put us behind schedule. Literally, all of my coworkers (whom I loved dearly) on the stock team left before I did because our managers never really treated us with respect and hardly gave us recognition. We got put down more than anything. Personally, I was degraded by my managers and they weren\'t the most understanding people when it came to personal issues. If I asked a question about the work, I would get smart or sarcastic responses as if I was stupid for asking.

There is a commission policy in place to encourage sales staff but the sales threshold required for the policy to be enacted make it impossible to achieve.  There is the illusion of a fair compensation policy.  Benefits other than wages are good and encourage staff retention but you cannot live in Toronto on the wages earned. ', ' My schedule was generally  8 to 5 pm and two closing shifts per week. I would come into work and check sales from the previous day,assign goals and delegate tasks as needed. I would merchandise new product onto the floor five days per week. All product received had to be out onto the floor so we were ready for business when the store opened. Once store was open we would start following up with any customers that needed to be taken care of as well as reaching out to new customers to set appointments for styling. I would partner with the team to help sell in order to help their business as well as the departments.

', ' Same as that is for Nordstrom Production Support - Nearshore ', ' Job consisted of routine surveillance (both physical and CCTV), weekly department audits and creating strong relationships with both employees and management. Nordstrom creates an amazing work environment which is relaxed and objective. Rapidly expanding company with plenty of opportunity for growth and promotion, but not within the store which I worked at. Management within the Loss Prevention department created a difficult work experience via scheduling and negligence in training agents to become "released". Training process was not catered towards the individual which caused a lapse in training. ', " Nordstrom will take you through a series of lessons and education about the position. Management is pretty encouraging &amp; respectful. However, being that everyone is on high commission, its a pretty competitive environment. There are certain employees who will be very competitive and will do anything to sell the most. Retail is long hours, and what is frustrating is the fact that Nordstrom's policy allows basically anything to be returned no questions asked, so your sales numbers go up and down frequently. The sales goals are also very high. The employee discount is alright but nothing great. It really comes down to how competitive of a sales person you are and if you enjoy the retail commission atmosphere. ", ' Nordstrom is a great company, has room for growth and also a good starting job for any one interested in retail! working for the company i have learned how to work with others and take that experience to the next level of coaching others in the role ahead. one awesome fact is they make it easy to transfer across america and stay with the company! when it comes to management at Nordstrom there is a little brushing up to do, across the bored equality and appreciation everything the employee brings to the company. The hardest part of the job for me was the scheduling, effecting structure in your outside life and the work overload in some locations. Last but not least the most enjoyable part depending on location, the team work involved every day to drive numbers and always putting the customer first! ', ' I started with Nordstrom in Dallas and it was a Dream job. Everything was perfect: management, compensation, culture, etc. I was promoted quickly and eventually wanted to try something new in a different region. I chose the NE. Bad decision. Completely different caliber of people and culture. Just terrible. It broke my fervor for the company and my career within it. Had I chose a different region I would have probably been an employee for life. ', " Overall Nordstrom is a fantastic place to work at. The culture is why people will stay a lifetime. Your customers and coworkers become family and are the inspiration to keep you motivated to always be better. The policies and upper management encourage your own critical thinking and problem solving to make the business your own. Of course there is stress and emotions when you work alongside commission and metric based roles ... it can take a lot out of your creativity and motivation. Isn't that most jobs? ", ' Nordstrom I can tell strives to hire people who are easy going and are open minded to working with a range of diverse groups. The one thing I love about working at Nordstrom is how diverse it is and how different departments still mingle together.  I currently work at the EBAR, so it is a little bit different than a traditional job at Nordstrom. Being at the EBAR it is impossible to get the opportunity to move up because the management would rather hire externally, than from the group of employees that already work there. This aspect would have to be the hardest part about my job.  I do enjoy making friendships and connections with the regulars that come into our coffee bar. That would be the most enjoyable part of my job. ', " A typical day at Nordstrom is horrible. The managers that they hire for the position are not manger material. They do not listen to their employees unless you are friend , or if they like you.The mangers work you like crazy. My manger will give me eight tasks to do and it has to be completed by the end of my shift. My manger is not well organize and she does not know how to manage at all. T The co-workers are extremely nice. I haven't had any problems with my co-workers. It is not the best company to work for. ", " Nordstrom is a very established premium retail company based in Seattle Washington.   Very open and friendly workplace with  room for advancement depending on one's desires and abilities.   Compensation, healthcare, 401K,  employee stock purchases, are good. ", ' Typical day at work varied. There was alot of unorganization. Sales goals could be unattainable given the current seasons. I did learn about products and their uses. Management varied. Alot of politics involved. Promotions arent based on numbers and a persons sales. My coworkers were pleasant for trh most part. There is no job security. Benefits can be taken away at any given time for lack of hours but schedule is done "based on business". Not ideal for a person with real bills. The most enjoyable part of the job was constantly excersing my craft. ', ' Nordstrom is a great place to work, especially as a starter job. They pay very well, and make you feel valuable. If retail is not your long term goal, I do not suggest falling in love with the company or you will find yourself for many years, and wondering where the time went. It is a great job to have while in school because they will work with your schedule regardless of how few hours you wish to work. ', " As a company, Nordstrom is a great company to work for. I've been fortunate enough to work with amazing people across many aspects of the company. Their employees are the number one thing the company has going for it.  Nordstrom IT, on the other hand, is suffering at the hands of change. There is little guidance, strategy or support from management. Today's IT leadership is rudderless. They do not seem to care about their employees. Work-life balance is out of balance. ", ' Nordstrom has and will always be my favorite place to work. I took so many lessons from working here, not just work lessons but life lessons. I believe the reason behind my love for Nordstrom is the culture i enjoy fashion so i truly enjoy the life balance i achieved from working around and under leaders who believed in acknowledging you not only as an individual but as a team. My everyday goals here were to just be the best me i can be and let that shine to the customer. Which i was empowered to do each day. The area for advancement was also huge. I love to be rewarded for my good/ hard work and sometimes we were rewarded so much i began to wonder was i truly working this hard or did this company just enjoy taking care of its customers. This will forever and always be my favorite place to have worked. ', " Nordstrom is a great company for EVERYONE. If you're a student looking a for extra money or if you're seeking a career with growth opportunities, Nordstrom has a place and position for you. I am so blessed to be apart of a company that feels like family. They are quick to take care of their employees just as quickly as they take care of their customers. I never feel like I don't have a voice. Also, because they have so many locations including their Rack division, opportunities exist all over the country and now in Canada as well.  I've always felt well compensated since day one and the benefits have continued to grow in my almost 4 years with the company. I'm grateful. ", " The company has great ideas, and the direction it wants to go is good for their clients. Its a culture that revolves around a means well, dresses well type of hierarchy, but lacks actual character. The most enjoyable thing about working at the Rack was being surrounded by the products coming in, and out of the stores, also building close knit relationships with fellow sales associates, since we had opened with that same store. Soon after opening the store, I became more aware of the culture and how management wasn't stable in keeping a reliable person in charge. I strongly felt that as a sales associate for this company it was a great title to have but short lived compared to the reality, of the culture. I also did not want to grow with a company that seemed to change the people who are so indebted to the cause, that their ethics, and morals become distorted, and they treat workers down the cycle less than. ", ' Nordstrom is a great corporation because they are committed to promoting talent from within and ensuring career advancement to top performers. Retail commission based sales positions are great for college students who need part time jobs that offer autonomy, flexible schedules, and a competitive and fast paced work environment, and Nordstrom is no exception! ', " To be fair, this is the experience of a software developer, not someone in retail, so the perspective isn't the same for all of Nordstrom. They're trying to be a software company, and failing miserably. They are constantly shaking up management trying to get someone in who can deliver results in a time-frame expected by retail people (which is far to short for software development), and when it doesn't work they bring in new management. They are *far* more concerned about making sure your working hard than doing the right thing. And although they have good salary and benefits, the work environment is stifling (no walls anywhere, tiny desks, no privacy, and they're constantly re-arranging the layout of the floors). There's also only coffee to drink (not even any real creamer), and you have to pay to get anything else out of vending machines. ", ' Nordstrom is a great company to work for as far as management and employees go, however, there are very low chances of growing into a management role or it would take too long. It is not a place for people who wants to have a solid career. But if you have time and looking into making extra cash, it is better than most retailers.

Literally, all of my coworkers (whom I loved dearly) on the stock team left before I did because our managers never really treated us with respect and hardly gave us recognition.

Tight deadlines made it even more challenging and turned it into fun of its own kind. ', ' Same as that is for Nordstrom Production Support - Nearshore ', ' Job consisted of routine surveillance (both physical and CCTV), weekly department audits and creating strong relationships with both employees and management. Nordstrom creates an amazing work environment which is relaxed and objective. Rapidly expanding company with plenty of opportunity for growth and promotion, but not within the store which I worked at. Management within the Loss Prevention department created a difficult work experience via scheduling and negligence in training agents to become "released". Training process was not catered towards the individual which caused a lapse in training. ', " Nordstrom will take you through a series of lessons and education about the position. Management is pretty encouraging &amp; respectful. However, being that everyone is on high commission, its a pretty competitive environment. There are certain employees who will be very competitive and will do anything to sell the most. Retail is long hours, and what is frustrating is the fact that Nordstrom's policy allows basically anything to be returned no questions asked, so your sales numbers go up and down frequently. The sales goals are also very high. The employee discount is alright but nothing great. It really comes down to how competitive of a sales person you are and if you enjoy the retail commission atmosphere. ", ' Nordstrom is a great company, has room for growth and also a good starting job for any one interested in retail! working for the company i have learned how to work with others and take that experience to the next level of coaching others in the role ahead. one awesome fact is they make it easy to transfer across america and stay with the company! when it comes to management at Nordstrom there is a little brushing up to do, across the bored equality and appreciation everything the employee brings to the company. The hardest part of the job for me was the scheduling, effecting structure in your outside life and the work overload in some locations. Last but not least the most enjoyable part depending on location, the team work involved every day to drive numbers and always putting the customer first! ', ' I started with Nordstrom in Dallas and it was a Dream job. Everything was perfect: management, compensation, culture, etc. I was promoted quickly and eventually wanted to try something new in a different region. I chose the NE. Bad decision. Completely different caliber of people and culture. Just terrible. It broke my fervor for the company and my career within it. Had I chose a different region I would have probably been an employee for life. ', " Overall Nordstrom is a fantastic place to work at. The culture is why people will stay a lifetime. Your customers and coworkers become family and are the inspiration to keep you motivated to always be better. The policies and upper management encourage your own critical thinking and problem solving to make the business your own. Of course there is stress and emotions when you work alongside commission and metric based roles ... it can take a lot out of your creativity and motivation. Isn't that most jobs? ", ' Nordstrom I can tell strives to hire people who are easy going and are open minded to working with a range of diverse groups. The one thing I love about working at Nordstrom is how diverse it is and how different departments still mingle together.  I currently work at the EBAR, so it is a little bit different than a traditional job at Nordstrom. Being at the EBAR it is impossible to get the opportunity to move up because the management would rather hire externally, than from the group of employees that already work there. This aspect would have to be the hardest part about my job.  I do enjoy making friendships and connections with the regulars that come into our coffee bar. That would be the most enjoyable part of my job. ', " A typical day at Nordstrom is horrible. The managers that they hire for the position are not manger material. They do not listen to their employees unless you are friend , or if they like you.The mangers work you like crazy. My manger will give me eight tasks to do and it has to be completed by the end of my shift. My manger is not well organize and she does not know how to manage at all. T The co-workers are extremely nice. I haven't had any problems with my co-workers. It is not the best company to work for. ", " Nordstrom is a very established premium retail company based in Seattle Washington.   Very open and friendly workplace with  room for advancement depending on one's desires and abilities.   Compensation, healthcare, 401K,  employee stock purchases, are good. ", ' Typical day at work varied. There was alot of unorganization. Sales goals could be unattainable given the current seasons. I did learn about products and their uses. Management varied. Alot of politics involved. Promotions arent based on numbers and a persons sales. My coworkers were pleasant for trh most part. There is no job security. Benefits can be taken away at any given time for lack of hours but schedule is done "based on business". Not ideal for a person with real bills. The most enjoyable part of the job was constantly excersing my craft. ', ' Nordstrom is a great place to work, especially as a starter job. They pay very well, and make you feel valuable. If retail is not your long term goal, I do not suggest falling in love with the company or you will find yourself for many years, and wondering where the time went. It is a great job to have while in school because they will work with your schedule regardless of how few hours you wish to work. ', " As a company, Nordstrom is a great company to work for. I've been fortunate enough to work with amazing people across many aspects of the company. Their employees are the number one thing the company has going for it.  Nordstrom IT, on the other hand, is suffering at the hands of change. There is little guidance, strategy or support from management. Today's IT leadership is rudderless. They do not seem to care about their employees. Work-life balance is out of balance. ", ' Nordstrom has and will always be my favorite place to work. I took so many lessons from working here, not just work lessons but life lessons. I believe the reason behind my love for Nordstrom is the culture i enjoy fashion so i truly enjoy the life balance i achieved from working around and under leaders who believed in acknowledging you not only as an individual but as a team. My everyday goals here were to just be the best me i can be and let that shine to the customer. Which i was empowered to do each day. The area for advancement was also huge. I love to be rewarded for my good/ hard work and sometimes we were rewarded so much i began to wonder was i truly working this hard or did this company just enjoy taking care of its customers. This will forever and always be my favorite place to have worked. ', " Nordstrom is a great company for EVERYONE. If you're a student looking a for extra money or if you're seeking a career with growth opportunities, Nordstrom has a place and position for you. I am so blessed to be apart of a company that feels like family. They are quick to take care of their employees just as quickly as they take care of their customers. I never feel like I don't have a voice. Also, because they have so many locations including their Rack division, opportunities exist all over the country and now in Canada as well.  I've always felt well compensated since day one and the benefits have continued to grow in my almost 4 years with the company. I'm grateful. ", " The company has great ideas, and the direction it wants to go is good for their clients. Its a culture that revolves around a means well, dresses well type of hierarchy, but lacks actual character. The most enjoyable thing about working at the Rack was being surrounded by the products coming in, and out of the stores, also building close knit relationships with fellow sales associates, since we had opened with that same store. Soon after opening the store, I became more aware of the culture and how management wasn't stable in keeping a reliable person in charge. I strongly felt that as a sales associate for this company it was a great title to have but short lived compared to the reality, of the culture. I also did not want to grow with a company that seemed to change the people who are so indebted to the cause, that their ethics, and morals become distorted, and they treat workers down the cycle less than. ", ' Nordstrom is a great corporation because they are committed to promoting talent from within and ensuring career advancement to top performers. Retail commission based sales positions are great for college students who need part time jobs that offer autonomy, flexible schedules, and a competitive and fast paced work environment, and Nordstrom is no exception! ', " To be fair, this is the experience of a software developer, not someone in retail, so the perspective isn't the same for all of Nordstrom. They're trying to be a software company, and failing miserably. They are constantly shaking up management trying to get someone in who can deliver results in a time-frame expected by retail people (which is far to short for software development), and when it doesn't work they bring in new management. They are *far* more concerned about making sure your working hard than doing the right thing. And although they have good salary and benefits, the work environment is stifling (no walls anywhere, tiny desks, no privacy, and they're constantly re-arranging the layout of the floors). There's also only coffee to drink (not even any real creamer), and you have to pay to get anything else out of vending machines. ", ' Nordstrom is a great company to work for as far as management and employees go, however, there are very low chances of growing into a management role or it would take too long. It is not a place for people who wants to have a solid career. But if you have time and looking into making extra cash, it is better than most retailers.

The one thing I love about working at Nordstrom is how diverse it is and how different departments still mingle together.  I currently work at the EBAR, so it is a little bit different than a traditional job at Nordstrom. Being at the EBAR it is impossible to get the opportunity to move up because the management would rather hire externally, than from the group of employees that already work there.

Had I chose a different region I would have probably been an employee for life. ', ' Nordstrom is a great company with a strong desire to create a fantastic environment for their customers. The structure of command is an inverted pyramid which shows that Customers are what keep the company alive and the employees on the front line, at the store level are most important. With that being said there is no structure for moving up within the company and you get different answers or the run around when asking for help. When I first started with the company no one explained about the benefits or where to go to find answers so I was in the dark a lot. The employees I work with are fun and I enjoy seeing them every day, however there are clicks within the company and a lot of gossip. I enjoyed wearing what I wanted to work and being able to adjust my hours to get off earlier. Everyone is positive and a team player. The technology they use, for example direct deposit comes in 3 days after your payday, is behind. ', " As a company, Nordstrom is a great company to work for. I've been fortunate enough to work with amazing people across many aspects of the company. Their employees are the number one thing the company has going for it.  Nordstrom IT, on the other hand, is suffering at the hands of change. There is little guidance, strategy or support from management. Today's IT leadership is rudderless.

Yes there were challenges, but overall, it was great working with other individuals who were goal driven and encouraging.

My schedule would say 11:30 but I NEVER left on time, most of the time I would leave at around 1PM because we were either understaffed or doing unnecessary tasks that put us behind schedule. Literally, all of my coworkers (whom I loved dearly) on the stock team left before I did because our managers never really treated us with respect and hardly gave us recognition. We got put down more than anything. Personally, I was degraded by my managers and they weren\'t the most understanding people when it came to personal issues. If I asked a question about the work, I would get smart or sarcastic responses as if I was stupid for asking. They boast this "open door policy" and when my coworkers took advantage of this benefit and spoke up about issues going on, things were peachy for about 3 days and then back to the same ol\'. The company itself is great, though! Always did things for charity, potlucks, and when times got hard for me financially, they did help.

There is a commission policy in place to encourage sales staff but the sales threshold required for the policy to be enacted make it impossible to achieve.  There is the illusion of a fair compensation policy.  Benefits other than wages are good and encourage staff retention but you cannot live in Toronto on the wages earned. ', ' My schedule was generally  8 to 5 pm and two closing shifts per week. I would come into work and check sales from the previous day,assign goals and delegate tasks as needed. I would merchandise new product onto the floor five days per week. All product received had to be out onto the floor so we were ready for business when the store opened. Once store was open we would start following up with any customers that needed to be taken care of as well as reaching out to new customers to set appointments for styling. I would partner with the team to help sell in order to help their business as well as the departments.

The one thing I love about working at Nordstrom is how diverse it is and how different departments still mingle together.  I currently work at the EBAR, so it is a little bit different than a traditional job at Nordstrom. Being at the EBAR it is impossible to get the opportunity to move up because the management would rather hire externally, than from the group of employees that already work there.

Had I chose a different region I would have probably been an employee for life. ', ' Nordstrom is a great company with a strong desire to create a fantastic environment for their customers. The structure of command is an inverted pyramid which shows that Customers are what keep the company alive and the employees on the front line, at the store level are most important. With that being said there is no structure for moving up within the company and you get different answers or the run around when asking for help. When I first started with the company no one explained about the benefits or where to go to find answers so I was in the dark a lot. The employees I work with are fun and I enjoy seeing them every day, however there are clicks within the company and a lot of gossip. I enjoyed wearing what I wanted to work and being able to adjust my hours to get off earlier. Everyone is positive and a team player. The technology they use, for example direct deposit comes in 3 days after your payday, is behind. ', " As a company, Nordstrom is a great company to work for. I've been fortunate enough to work with amazing people across many aspects of the company. Their employees are the number one thing the company has going for it.  Nordstrom IT, on the other hand, is suffering at the hands of change. There is little guidance, strategy or support from management. Today's IT leadership is rudderless.

I worked in both Accessories and Service Experience. I liked being on the floor and assisting people with making selections or giving advice on what would be better for them. But in Service experience, I liked having the constant interaction with customers while checking them out. Yes there were challenges, but overall, it was great working with other individuals who were goal driven and encouraging. ', " At first your led to believe Nordstrom really cares about their people, and wants to hear their thoughts. You quickly find out this isn't so. Management has there favorites, and in order to be seen you must kiss up. Doing your job isn't enough, your'e encouraged to NOT think out of the box. My first year there was great, because they had a more caring management team, but as time went on people left, and new management just didn't care about the family business feel they were once fostering.

Compensation, healthcare, 401K,  employee stock purchases, are good. ", ' Normal day as a stockperson is coming in at 4:30 AM and leaving whenever the manager tells you to. My schedule would say 11:30 but I NEVER left on time, most of the time I would leave at around 1PM because we were either understaffed or doing unnecessary tasks that put us behind schedule. Literally, all of my coworkers (whom I loved dearly) on the stock team left before I did because our managers never really treated us with respect and hardly gave us recognition. We got put down more than anything. Personally, I was degraded by my managers and they weren\'t the most understanding people when it came to personal issues. If I asked a question about the work, I would get smart or sarcastic responses as if I was stupid for asking. They boast this "open door policy" and when my coworkers took advantage of this benefit and spoke up about issues going on, things were peachy for about 3 days and then back to the same ol\'. The company itself is great, though! Always did things for charity, potlucks, and when times got hard for me financially, they did help.

There is a commission policy in place to encourage sales staff but the sales threshold required for the policy to be enacted make it impossible to achieve.  There is the illusion of a fair compensation policy.  Benefits other than wages are good and encourage staff retention but you cannot live in Toronto on the wages earned. ', ' My schedule was generally  8 to 5 pm and two closing shifts per week. I would come into work and check sales from the previous day,assign goals and delegate tasks as needed. I would merchandise new product onto the floor five days per week. All product received had to be out onto the floor so we were ready for business when the store opened. Once store was open we would start following up with any customers that needed to be taken care of as well as reaching out to new customers to set appointments for styling. I would partner with the team to help sell in order to help their business as well as the departments. I learned that every person is different, you have to be able to work with that individual person, that people work for people.

Once store was open we would start following up with any customers that needed to be taken care of as well as reaching out to new customers to set appointments for styling. I would partner with the team to help sell in order to help their business as well as the departments.

Soon after opening the store, I became more aware of the culture and how management wasn't stable in keeping a reliable person in charge. I strongly felt that as a sales associate for this company it was a great title to have but short lived compared to the reality, of the culture.

When I first started with the company no one explained about the benefits or where to go to find answers so I was in the dark a lot. The employees I work with are fun and I enjoy seeing them every day, however there are clicks within the company and a lot of gossip.

Retail is long hours, and what is frustrating is the fact that Nordstrom's policy allows basically anything to be returned no questions asked, so your sales numbers go up and down frequently.

The one thing I love about working at Nordstrom is how diverse it is and how different departments still mingle together.  I currently work at the EBAR, so it is a little bit different than a traditional job at Nordstrom. Being at the EBAR it is impossible to get the opportunity to move up because the management would rather hire externally, than from the group of employees that already work there.

Its a culture that revolves around a means well, dresses well type of hierarchy, but lacks actual character. The most enjoyable thing about working at the Rack was being surrounded by the products coming in, and out of the stores, also building close knit relationships with fellow sales associates, since we had opened with that same store. Soon after opening the store, I became more aware of the culture and how management wasn't stable in keeping a reliable person in charge. I strongly felt that as a sales associate for this company it was a great title to have but short lived compared to the reality, of the culture.

They're trying to be a software company, and failing miserably. They are constantly shaking up management trying to get someone in who can deliver results in a time-frame expected by retail people (which is far to short for software development), and when it doesn't work they bring in new management. They are *far* more concerned about making sure your working hard than doing the right thing. And although they have good salary and benefits, the work environment is stifling (no walls anywhere, tiny desks, no privacy, and they're constantly re-arranging the layout of the floors). There's also only coffee to drink (not even any real creamer), and you have to pay to get anything else out of vending machines.

It's very difficult to be promoted internally even though they tout themselves for doing so. ", ' Nordstrom was a excellent company to work for, the management was very helpful and assisted you whenever possible. This was a seasonal position my only regret was that the job ended. My position entailed assisting online Customers with their shopping needs and filling their orders including packaging labeling, shipping and receiving. The culture was very upbeat and the employees worked together to assist one another in completing tasks. It was my pleasure to have worked there. ', " My typical work day consisted of duties that should have been carried out by management. I went above and beyond to make sure the department ran efficiently. On countless occasions, I stayed more than 2 hours past my scheduled shift. At the end of the day, that wasn't good enough according to the unqualified manager they brought in. This manager takes pride in throwing around the title of being manager, instead of focusing on getting the department in order. The company baited me in based on lies. They need to get back to the core of what they claim to stand for. The best part about being there, turned out to not even matter in the end.

There is a commission policy in place to encourage sales staff but the sales threshold required for the policy to be enacted make it impossible to achieve.  There is the illusion of a fair compensation policy.  Benefits other than wages are good and encourage staff retention but you cannot live in Toronto on the wages earned.

Nordstrom creates an amazing work environment which is relaxed and objective. Rapidly expanding company with plenty of opportunity for growth and promotion, but not within the store which I worked at. Management within the Loss Prevention department created a difficult work experience via scheduling and negligence in training agents to become "released". Training process was not catered towards the individual which caused a lapse in training. ', " Nordstrom will take you through a series of lessons and education about the position. Management is pretty encouraging &amp; respectful. However, being that everyone is on high commission, its a pretty competitive environment. There are certain employees who will be very competitive and will do anything to sell the most. Retail is long hours, and what is frustrating is the fact that Nordstrom's policy allows basically anything to be returned no questions asked, so your sales numbers go up and down frequently. The sales goals are also very high. The employee discount is alright but nothing great. It really comes down to how competitive of a sales person you are and if you enjoy the retail commission atmosphere. ", ' Nordstrom is a great company, has room for growth and also a good starting job for any one interested in retail! working for the company i have learned how to work with others and take that experience to the next level of coaching others in the role ahead. one awesome fact is they make it easy to transfer across america and stay with the company! when it comes to management at Nordstrom there is a little brushing up to do, across the bored equality and appreciation everything the employee brings to the company. The hardest part of the job for me was the scheduling, effecting structure in your outside life and the work overload in some locations. Last but not least the most enjoyable part depending on location, the team work involved every day to drive numbers and always putting the customer first!

Everything was perfect: management, compensation, culture, etc. I was promoted quickly and eventually wanted to try something new in a different region. I chose the NE. Bad decision. Completely different caliber of people and culture. Just terrible. It broke my fervor for the company and my career within it. Had I chose a different region I would have probably been an employee for life. ', " Overall Nordstrom is a fantastic place to work at. The culture is why people will stay a lifetime. Your customers and coworkers become family and are the inspiration to keep you motivated to always be better. The policies and upper management encourage your own critical thinking and problem solving to make the business your own. Of course there is stress and emotions when you work alongside commission and metric based roles ... it can take a lot out of your creativity and motivation. Isn't that most jobs? ", ' Nordstrom I can tell strives to hire people who are easy going and are open minded to working with a range of diverse groups. The one thing I love about working at Nordstrom is how diverse it is and how different departments still mingle together.  I currently work at the EBAR, so it is a little bit different than a traditional job at Nordstrom. Being at the EBAR it is impossible to get the opportunity to move up because the management would rather hire externally, than from the group of employees that already work there. This aspect would have to be the hardest part about my job.  I do enjoy making friendships and connections with the regulars that come into our coffee bar. That would be the most enjoyable part of my job. ', " A typical day at Nordstrom is horrible. The managers that they hire for the position are not manger material. They do not listen to their employees unless you are friend , or if they like you.The mangers work you like crazy. My manger will give me eight tasks to do and it has to be completed by the end of my shift. My manger is not well organize and she does not know how to manage at all.

I did learn about products and their uses. Management varied. Alot of politics involved. Promotions arent based on numbers and a persons sales. My coworkers were pleasant for trh most part. There is no job security. Benefits can be taken away at any given time for lack of hours but schedule is done "based on business". Not ideal for a person with real bills.

I've been fortunate enough to work with amazing people across many aspects of the company. Their employees are the number one thing the company has going for it.  Nordstrom IT, on the other hand, is suffering at the hands of change. There is little guidance, strategy or support from management. Today's IT leadership is rudderless. They do not seem to care about their employees. Work-life balance is out of balance. ", ' Nordstrom has and will always be my favorite place to work. I took so many lessons from working here, not just work lessons but life lessons. I believe the reason behind my love for Nordstrom is the culture i enjoy fashion so i truly enjoy the life balance i achieved from working around and under leaders who believed in acknowledging you not only as an individual but as a team. My everyday goals here were to just be the best me i can be and let that shine to the customer. Which i was empowered to do each day. The area for advancement was also huge. I love to be rewarded for my good/ hard work and sometimes we were rewarded so much i began to wonder was i truly working this hard or did this company just enjoy taking care of its customers. This will forever and always be my favorite place to have worked. ', " Nordstrom is a great company for EVERYONE. If you're a student looking a for extra money or if you're seeking a career with growth opportunities, Nordstrom has a place and position for you. I am so blessed to be apart of a company that feels like family. They are quick to take care of their employees just as quickly as they take care of their customers. I never feel like I don't have a voice. Also, because they have so many locations including their Rack division, opportunities exist all over the country and now in Canada as well.  I've always felt well compensated since day one and the benefits have continued to grow in my almost 4 years with the company. I'm grateful. ", " The company has great ideas, and the direction it wants to go is good for their clients. Its a culture that revolves around a means well, dresses well type of hierarchy, but lacks actual character. The most enjoyable thing about working at the Rack was being surrounded by the products coming in, and out of the stores, also building close knit relationships with fellow sales associates, since we had opened with that same store. Soon after opening the store, I became more aware of the culture and how management wasn't stable in keeping a reliable person in charge. I strongly felt that as a sales associate for this company it was a great title to have but short lived compared to the reality, of the culture. I also did not want to grow with a company that seemed to change the people who are so indebted to the cause, that their ethics, and morals become distorted, and they treat workers down the cycle less than.

Retail commission based sales positions are great for college students who need part time jobs that offer autonomy, flexible schedules, and a competitive and fast paced work environment, and Nordstrom is no exception! ', " To be fair, this is the experience of a software developer, not someone in retail, so the perspective isn't the same for all of Nordstrom. They're trying to be a software company, and failing miserably. They are constantly shaking up management trying to get someone in who can deliver results in a time-frame expected by retail people (which is far to short for software development), and when it doesn't work they bring in new management. They are *far* more concerned about making sure your working hard than doing the right thing. And although they have good salary and benefits, the work environment is stifling (no walls anywhere, tiny desks, no privacy, and they're constantly re-arranging the layout of the floors). There's also only coffee to drink (not even any real creamer), and you have to pay to get anything else out of vending machines.

', ' Same as that is for Nordstrom Production Support - Nearshore ', ' Job consisted of routine surveillance (both physical and CCTV), weekly department audits and creating strong relationships with both employees and management. Nordstrom creates an amazing work environment which is relaxed and objective. Rapidly expanding company with plenty of opportunity for growth and promotion, but not within the store which I worked at. Management within the Loss Prevention department created a difficult work experience via scheduling and negligence in training agents to become "released". Training process was not catered towards the individual which caused a lapse in training. ', ' Nordstrom is a great company, has room for growth and also a good starting job for any one interested in retail! working for the company i have learned how to work with others and take that experience to the next level of coaching others in the role ahead. one awesome fact is they make it easy to transfer across america and stay with the company! when it comes to management at Nordstrom there is a little brushing up to do, across the bored equality and appreciation everything the employee brings to the company. The hardest part of the job for me was the scheduling, effecting structure in your outside life and the work overload in some locations. Last but not least the most enjoyable part depending on location, the team work involved every day to drive numbers and always putting the customer first!

I am so blessed to be apart of a company that feels like family. They are quick to take care of their employees just as quickly as they take care of their customers. I never feel like I don't have a voice. Also, because they have so many locations including their Rack division, opportunities exist all over the country and now in Canada as well.  I've always felt well compensated since day one and the benefits have continued to grow in my almost 4 years with the company. I'm grateful. ", " A typical day at Nordstrom is horrible. The managers that they hire for the position are not manger material. They do not listen to their employees unless you are friend , or if they like you.The mangers work you like crazy. My manger will give me eight tasks to do and it has to be completed by the end of my shift. My manger is not well organize and she does not know how to manage at all. T The co-workers are extremely nice. I haven't had any problems with my co-workers. It is not the best company to work for. ", " To be fair, this is the experience of a software developer, not someone in retail, so the perspective isn't the same for all of Nordstrom. They're trying to be a software company, and failing miserably. They are constantly shaking up management trying to get someone in who can deliver results in a time-frame expected by retail people (which is far to short for software development), and when it doesn't work they bring in new management. They are *far* more concerned about making sure your working hard than doing the right thing. And although they have good salary and benefits, the work environment is stifling (no walls anywhere, tiny desks, no privacy, and they're constantly re-arranging the layout of the floors). There's also only coffee to drink (not even any real creamer), and you have to pay to get anything else out of vending machines. ", " Overall Nordstrom is a fantastic place to work at. The culture is why people will stay a lifetime. Your customers and coworkers become family and are the inspiration to keep you motivated to always be better. The policies and upper management encourage your own critical thinking and problem solving to make the business your own. Of course there is stress and emotions when you work alongside commission and metric based roles ... it can take a lot out of your creativity and motivation. Isn't that most jobs? ", ' Nordstrom I can tell strives to hire people who are easy going and are open minded to working with a range of diverse groups. The one thing I love about working at Nordstrom is how diverse it is and how different departments still mingle together.  I currently work at the EBAR, so it is a little bit different than a traditional job at Nordstrom. Being at the EBAR it is impossible to get the opportunity to move up because the management would rather hire externally, than from the group of employees that already work there. This aspect would have to be the hardest part about my job.  I do enjoy making friendships and connections with the regulars that come into our coffee bar. That would be the most enjoyable part of my job. ', ' I started with Nordstrom in Dallas and it was a Dream job. Everything was perfect: management, compensation, culture, etc. I was promoted quickly and eventually wanted to try something new in a different region. I chose the NE. Bad decision. Completely different caliber of people and culture. Just terrible. It broke my fervor for the company and my career within it. Had I chose a different region I would have probably been an employee for life. ', ' Nordstrom is a great company with a strong desire to create a fantastic environment for their customers. The structure of command is an inverted pyramid which shows that Customers are what keep the company alive and the employees on the front line, at the store level are most important. With that being said there is no structure for moving up within the company and you get different answers or the run around when asking for help. When I first started with the company no one explained about the benefits or where to go to find answers so I was in the dark a lot. The employees I work with are fun and I enjoy seeing them every day, however there are clicks within the company and a lot of gossip. I enjoyed wearing what I wanted to work and being able to adjust my hours to get off earlier. Everyone is positive and a team player. The technology they use, for example direct deposit comes in 3 days after your payday, is behind. ', " As a company, Nordstrom is a great company to work for. I've been fortunate enough to work with amazing people across many aspects of the company. Their employees are the number one thing the company has going for it.  Nordstrom IT, on the other hand, is suffering at the hands of change. There is little guidance, strategy or support from management. Today's IT leadership is rudderless. They do not seem to care about their employees. Work-life balance is out of balance. ", ' I had a great time working at Nordstrom...I was actually at the Rack and I had a great time. I worked in both Accessories and Service Experience. I liked being on the floor and assisting people with making selections or giving advice on what would be better for them. But in Service experience, I liked having the constant interaction with customers while checking them out. Yes there were challenges, but overall, it was great working with other individuals who were goal driven and encouraging. ', " At first your led to believe Nordstrom really cares about their people, and wants to hear their thoughts. You quickly find out this isn't so. Management has there favorites, and in order to be seen you must kiss up. Doing your job isn't enough, your'e encouraged to NOT think out of the box. My first year there was great, because they had a more caring management team, but as time went on people left, and new management just didn't care about the family business feel they were once fostering. ", ' Nordstrom is a great place to work, especially as a starter job. They pay very well, and make you feel valuable. If retail is not your long term goal, I do not suggest falling in love with the company or you will find yourself for many years, and wondering where the time went. It is a great job to have while in school because they will work with your schedule regardless of how few hours you wish to work.

Compensation, healthcare, 401K,  employee stock purchases, are good. ", ' Normal day as a stockperson is coming in at 4:30 AM and leaving whenever the manager tells you to. My schedule would say 11:30 but I NEVER left on time, most of the time I would leave at around 1PM because we were either understaffed or doing unnecessary tasks that put us behind schedule. Literally, all of my coworkers (whom I loved dearly) on the stock team left before I did because our managers never really treated us with respect and hardly gave us recognition. We got put down more than anything. Personally, I was degraded by my managers and they weren\'t the most understanding people when it came to personal issues. If I asked a question about the work, I would get smart or sarcastic responses as if I was stupid for asking. They boast this "open door policy" and when my coworkers took advantage of this benefit and spoke up about issues going on, things were peachy for about 3 days and then back to the same ol\'. The company itself is great, though! Always did things for charity, potlucks, and when times got hard for me financially, they did help. ', ' Nordstrom is a major retail merchandiser with a successful presence in the North American market.  It is well designed and very well managed, as you would expect.  There is a commission policy in place to encourage sales staff but the sales threshold required for the policy to be enacted make it impossible to achieve.  There is the illusion of a fair compensation policy.  Benefits other than wages are good and encourage staff retention but you cannot live in Toronto on the wages earned. ', ' My schedule was generally  8 to 5 pm and two closing shifts per week. I would come into work and check sales from the previous day,assign goals and delegate tasks as needed. I would merchandise new product onto the floor five days per week. All product received had to be out onto the floor so we were ready for business when the store opened. Once store was open we would start following up with any customers that needed to be taken care of as well as reaching out to new customers to set appointments for styling. I would partner with the team to help sell in order to help their business as well as the departments. I learned that every person is different, you have to be able to work with that individual person, that people work for people. The reason I worked for Nordstrom was my customers and delivering great customer service. I also love to merchandise all the exciting new product. ', ' Typical day at work varied. There was alot of unorganization. Sales goals could be unattainable given the current seasons. I did learn about products and their uses. Management varied. Alot of politics involved. Promotions arent based on numbers and a persons sales. My coworkers were pleasant for trh most part. There is no job security.

Customers were disappointed in the selections, and the lack of popular brands such as St. John, Canali, Ferragamo, and others.

This manager takes pride in throwing around the title of being manager, instead of focusing on getting the department in order. The company baited me in based on lies.

They're trying to be a software company, and failing miserably. They are constantly shaking up management trying to get someone in who can deliver results in a time-frame expected by retail people (which is far to short for software development), and when it doesn't work they bring in new management. They are *far* more concerned about making sure your working hard than doing the right thing. And although they have good salary and benefits, the work environment is stifling (no walls anywhere, tiny desks, no privacy, and they're constantly re-arranging the layout of the floors). There's also only coffee to drink (not even any real creamer), and you have to pay to get anything else out of vending machines. ", " Overall Nordstrom is a fantastic place to work at. The culture is why people will stay a lifetime. Your customers and coworkers become family and are the inspiration to keep you motivated to always be better. The policies and upper management encourage your own critical thinking and problem solving to make the business your own. Of course there is stress and emotions when you work alongside commission and metric based roles ... it can take a lot out of your creativity and motivation. Isn't that most jobs? ", ' Nordstrom I can tell strives to hire people who are easy going and are open minded to working with a range of diverse groups. The one thing I love about working at Nordstrom is how diverse it is and how different departments still mingle together.  I currently work at the EBAR, so it is a little bit different than a traditional job at Nordstrom. Being at the EBAR it is impossible to get the opportunity to move up because the management would rather hire externally, than from the group of employees that already work there. This aspect would have to be the hardest part about my job.  I do enjoy making friendships and connections with the regulars that come into our coffee bar. That would be the most enjoyable part of my job. ', ' I started with Nordstrom in Dallas and it was a Dream job. Everything was perfect: management, compensation, culture, etc. I was promoted quickly and eventually wanted to try something new in a different region. I chose the NE. Bad decision. Completely different caliber of people and culture. Just terrible. It broke my fervor for the company and my career within it. Had I chose a different region I would have probably been an employee for life. ', ' Nordstrom is a great company with a strong desire to create a fantastic environment for their customers. The structure of command is an inverted pyramid which shows that Customers are what keep the company alive and the employees on the front line, at the store level are most important. With that being said there is no structure for moving up within the company and you get different answers or the run around when asking for help. When I first started with the company no one explained about the benefits or where to go to find answers so I was in the dark a lot. The employees I work with are fun and I enjoy seeing them every day, however there are clicks within the company and a lot of gossip. I enjoyed wearing what I wanted to work and being able to adjust my hours to get off earlier. Everyone is positive and a team player. The technology they use, for example direct deposit comes in 3 days after your payday, is behind. ', " As a company, Nordstrom is a great company to work for. I've been fortunate enough to work with amazing people across many aspects of the company. Their employees are the number one thing the company has going for it.  Nordstrom IT, on the other hand, is suffering at the hands of change. There is little guidance, strategy or support from management. Today's IT leadership is rudderless. They do not seem to care about their employees. Work-life balance is out of balance. ", ' I had a great time working at Nordstrom...I was actually at the Rack and I had a great time. I worked in both Accessories and Service Experience. I liked being on the floor and assisting people with making selections or giving advice on what would be better for them.

Yes there were challenges, but overall, it was great working with other individuals who were goal driven and encouraging.

My schedule would say 11:30 but I NEVER left on time, most of the time I would leave at around 1PM because we were either understaffed or doing unnecessary tasks that put us behind schedule. Literally, all of my coworkers (whom I loved dearly) on the stock team left before I did because our managers never really treated us with respect and hardly gave us recognition. We got put down more than anything. Personally, I was degraded by my managers and they weren\'t the most understanding people when it came to personal issues. If I asked a question about the work, I would get smart or sarcastic responses as if I was stupid for asking. They boast this "open door policy" and when my coworkers took advantage of this benefit and spoke up about issues going on, things were peachy for about 3 days and then back to the same ol\'.

', ' My schedule was generally  8 to 5 pm and two closing shifts per week. I would come into work and check sales from the previous day,assign goals and delegate tasks as needed. I would merchandise new product onto the floor five days per week. All product received had to be out onto the floor so we were ready for business when the store opened. Once store was open we would start following up with any customers that needed to be taken care of as well as reaching out to new customers to set appointments for styling.

T The co-workers are extremely nice. I haven't had any problems with my co-workers. It is not the best company to work for. ", " To be fair, this is the experience of a software developer, not someone in retail, so the perspective isn't the same for all of Nordstrom. They're trying to be a software company, and failing miserably. They are constantly shaking up management trying to get someone in who can deliver results in a time-frame expected by retail people (which is far to short for software development), and when it doesn't work they bring in new management. They are *far* more concerned about making sure your working hard than doing the right thing. And although they have good salary and benefits, the work environment is stifling (no walls anywhere, tiny desks, no privacy, and they're constantly re-arranging the layout of the floors). There's also only coffee to drink (not even any real creamer), and you have to pay to get anything else out of vending machines. ", " Overall Nordstrom is a fantastic place to work at. The culture is why people will stay a lifetime. Your customers and coworkers become family and are the inspiration to keep you motivated to always be better. The policies and upper management encourage your own critical thinking and problem solving to make the business your own. Of course there is stress and emotions when you work alongside commission and metric based roles ... it can take a lot out of your creativity and motivation. Isn't that most jobs? ", ' Nordstrom I can tell strives to hire people who are easy going and are open minded to working with a range of diverse groups. The one thing I love about working at Nordstrom is how diverse it is and how different departments still mingle together.  I currently work at the EBAR, so it is a little bit different than a traditional job at Nordstrom. Being at the EBAR it is impossible to get the opportunity to move up because the management would rather hire externally, than from the group of employees that already work there. This aspect would have to be the hardest part about my job.  I do enjoy making friendships and connections with the regulars that come into our coffee bar. That would be the most enjoyable part of my job. ', ' I started with Nordstrom in Dallas and it was a Dream job. Everything was perfect: management, compensation, culture, etc. I was promoted quickly and eventually wanted to try something new in a different region. I chose the NE. Bad decision. Completely different caliber of people and culture. Just terrible. It broke my fervor for the company and my career within it. Had I chose a different region I would have probably been an employee for life. ', ' Nordstrom is a great company with a strong desire to create a fantastic environment for their customers. The structure of command is an inverted pyramid which shows that Customers are what keep the company alive and the employees on the front line, at the store level are most important. With that being said there is no structure for moving up within the company and you get different answers or the run around when asking for help. When I first started with the company no one explained about the benefits or where to go to find answers so I was in the dark a lot. The employees I work with are fun and I enjoy seeing them every day, however there are clicks within the company and a lot of gossip. I enjoyed wearing what I wanted to work and being able to adjust my hours to get off earlier. Everyone is positive and a team player. The technology they use, for example direct deposit comes in 3 days after your payday, is behind. ', " As a company, Nordstrom is a great company to work for. I've been fortunate enough to work with amazing people across many aspects of the company. Their employees are the number one thing the company has going for it.  Nordstrom IT, on the other hand, is suffering at the hands of change. There is little guidance, strategy or support from management. Today's IT leadership is rudderless. They do not seem to care about their employees. Work-life balance is out of balance. ", ' I had a great time working at Nordstrom...I was actually at the Rack and I had a great time. I worked in both Accessories and Service Experience. I liked being on the floor and assisting people with making selections or giving advice on what would be better for them. But in Service experience, I liked having the constant interaction with customers while checking them out. Yes there were challenges, but overall, it was great working with other individuals who were goal driven and encouraging. ', " At first your led to believe Nordstrom really cares about their people, and wants to hear their thoughts. You quickly find out this isn't so. Management has there favorites, and in order to be seen you must kiss up. Doing your job isn't enough, your'e encouraged to NOT think out of the box. My first year there was great, because they had a more caring management team, but as time went on people left, and new management just didn't care about the family business feel they were once fostering. ", ' Nordstrom is a great place to work, especially as a starter job. They pay very well, and make you feel valuable. If retail is not your long term goal, I do not suggest falling in love with the company or you will find yourself for many years, and wondering where the time went. It is a great job to have while in school because they will work with your schedule regardless of how few hours you wish to work. ', " Nordstrom is a very established premium retail company based in Seattle Washington.   Very open and friendly workplace with  room for advancement depending on one's desires and abilities.   Compensation, healthcare, 401K,  employee stock purchases, are good. ", ' Normal day as a stockperson is coming in at 4:30 AM and leaving whenever the manager tells you to. My schedule would say 11:30 but I NEVER left on time, most of the time I would leave at around 1PM because we were either understaffed or doing unnecessary tasks that put us behind schedule. Literally, all of my coworkers (whom I loved dearly) on the stock team left before I did because our managers never really treated us with respect and hardly gave us recognition. We got put down more than anything. Personally, I was degraded by my managers and they weren\'t the most understanding people when it came to personal issues. If I asked a question about the work, I would get smart or sarcastic responses as if I was stupid for asking. They boast this "open door policy" and when my coworkers took advantage of this benefit and spoke up about issues going on, things were peachy for about 3 days and then back to the same ol\'. The company itself is great, though! Always did things for charity, potlucks, and when times got hard for me financially, they did help. ', ' Nordstrom is a major retail merchandiser with a successful presence in the North American market.  It is well designed and very well managed, as you would expect.  There is a commission policy in place to encourage sales staff but the sales threshold required for the policy to be enacted make it impossible to achieve.  There is the illusion of a fair compensation policy.  Benefits other than wages are good and encourage staff retention but you cannot live in Toronto on the wages earned. ', ' My schedule was generally  8 to 5 pm and two closing shifts per week. I would come into work and check sales from the previous day,assign goals and delegate tasks as needed. I would merchandise new product onto the floor five days per week. All product received had to be out onto the floor so we were ready for business when the store opened. Once store was open we would start following up with any customers that needed to be taken care of as well as reaching out to new customers to set appointments for styling. I would partner with the team to help sell in order to help their business as well as the departments. I learned that every person is different, you have to be able to work with that individual person, that people work for people. The reason I worked for Nordstrom was my customers and delivering great customer service. I also love to merchandise all the exciting new product. ', ' Typical day at work varied. There was alot of unorganization. Sales goals could be unattainable given the current seasons. I did learn about products and their uses. Management varied. Alot of politics involved. Promotions arent based on numbers and a persons sales. My coworkers were pleasant for trh most part. There is no job security. Benefits can be taken away at any given time for lack of hours but schedule is done "based on business". Not ideal for a person with real bills.

My day is complete when I've put a smile on a face and a bag in their hand.  My mission is to encourage and inspire people to live their best life and be all they can be.  I engage, listen, and direct customer to suggestions of product they may be looking for. I restock, inventory, display, answer phones, send repairs out, problem solve and sell a lot of beautiful things. ", ' This store opened with a lot of fanfare, but quickly fell short of expectations.  Customers were disappointed in the selections, and the lack of popular brands such as St. John, Canali, Ferragamo, and others.  They began to compare the store to Dillards and just walked across the parking lot.  The training for salespeople was hurried and as a result, the Nordstrom culture was not set in place.  In general a great disappointment to employees and customers ', " A typical day at work was getting there 15 minutes before schedule. To be able to do anything that wasn't finished the night before. Also putting away stock that doesn't need to go out. I learned a lot about eye wear and eye care that i wasn't aware of before. Management is pretty good no problems really in that area.

It's very difficult to be promoted internally even though they tout themselves for doing so. ", ' Nordstrom was a excellent company to work for, the management was very helpful and assisted you whenever possible. This was a seasonal position my only regret was that the job ended. My position entailed assisting online Customers with their shopping needs and filling their orders including packaging labeling, shipping and receiving. The culture was very upbeat and the employees worked together to assist one another in completing tasks. It was my pleasure to have worked there. ', " My typical work day consisted of duties that should have been carried out by management. I went above and beyond to make sure the department ran efficiently. On countless occasions, I stayed more than 2 hours past my scheduled shift. At the end of the day, that wasn't good enough according to the unqualified manager they brought in. This manager takes pride in throwing around the title of being manager, instead of focusing on getting the department in order. The company baited me in based on lies. They need to get back to the core of what they claim to stand for. The best part about being there, turned out to not even matter in the end.

Nordstrom creates an amazing work environment which is relaxed and objective. Rapidly expanding company with plenty of opportunity for growth and promotion, but not within the store which I worked at. Management within the Loss Prevention department created a difficult work experience via scheduling and negligence in training agents to become "released". Training process was not catered towards the individual which caused a lapse in training. ', ' Nordstrom is a great company, has room for growth and also a good starting job for any one interested in retail! working for the company i have learned how to work with others and take that experience to the next level of coaching others in the role ahead. one awesome fact is they make it easy to transfer across america and stay with the company! when it comes to management at Nordstrom there is a little brushing up to do, across the bored equality and appreciation everything the employee brings to the company. The hardest part of the job for me was the scheduling, effecting structure in your outside life and the work overload in some locations. Last but not least the most enjoyable part depending on location, the team work involved every day to drive numbers and always putting the customer first!

I am so blessed to be apart of a company that feels like family. They are quick to take care of their employees just as quickly as they take care of their customers. I never feel like I don't have a voice. Also, because they have so many locations including their Rack division, opportunities exist all over the country and now in Canada as well.  I've always felt well compensated since day one and the benefits have continued to grow in my almost 4 years with the company. I'm grateful. ", " A typical day at Nordstrom is horrible. The managers that they hire for the position are not manger material. They do not listen to their employees unless you are friend , or if they like you.The mangers work you like crazy. My manger will give me eight tasks to do and it has to be completed by the end of my shift. My manger is not well organize and she does not know how to manage at all. T The co-workers are extremely nice. I haven't had any problems with my co-workers. It is not the best company to work for. ", " To be fair, this is the experience of a software developer, not someone in retail, so the perspective isn't the same for all of Nordstrom. They're trying to be a software company, and failing miserably. They are constantly shaking up management trying to get someone in who can deliver results in a time-frame expected by retail people (which is far to short for software development), and when it doesn't work they bring in new management. They are *far* more concerned about making sure your working hard than doing the right thing. And although they have good salary and benefits, the work environment is stifling (no walls anywhere, tiny desks, no privacy, and they're constantly re-arranging the layout of the floors). There's also only coffee to drink (not even any real creamer), and you have to pay to get anything else out of vending machines. ", " Overall Nordstrom is a fantastic place to work at. The culture is why people will stay a lifetime. Your customers and coworkers become family and are the inspiration to keep you motivated to always be better. The policies and upper management encourage your own critical thinking and problem solving to make the business your own. Of course there is stress and emotions when you work alongside commission and metric based roles ... it can take a lot out of your creativity and motivation. Isn't that most jobs? ", ' Nordstrom I can tell strives to hire people who are easy going and are open minded to working with a range of diverse groups. The one thing I love about working at Nordstrom is how diverse it is and how different departments still mingle together.  I currently work at the EBAR, so it is a little bit different than a traditional job at Nordstrom. Being at the EBAR it is impossible to get the opportunity to move up because the management would rather hire externally, than from the group of employees that already work there. This aspect would have to be the hardest part about my job.  I do enjoy making friendships and connections with the regulars that come into our coffee bar. That would be the most enjoyable part of my job. ', ' I started with Nordstrom in Dallas and it was a Dream job.

Had I chose a different region I would have probably been an employee for life. ', ' Nordstrom is a great company with a strong desire to create a fantastic environment for their customers. The structure of command is an inverted pyramid which shows that Customers are what keep the company alive and the employees on the front line, at the store level are most important. With that being said there is no structure for moving up within the company and you get different answers or the run around when asking for help. When I first started with the company no one explained about the benefits or where to go to find answers so I was in the dark a lot. The employees I work with are fun and I enjoy seeing them every day, however there are clicks within the company and a lot of gossip. I enjoyed wearing what I wanted to work and being able to adjust my hours to get off earlier. Everyone is positive and a team player. The technology they use, for example direct deposit comes in 3 days after your payday, is behind. ', " As a company, Nordstrom is a great company to work for. I've been fortunate enough to work with amazing people across many aspects of the company. Their employees are the number one thing the company has going for it.  Nordstrom IT, on the other hand, is suffering at the hands of change. There is little guidance, strategy or support from management. Today's IT leadership is rudderless. They do not seem to care about their employees. Work-life balance is out of balance. ", ' I had a great time working at Nordstrom...I was actually at the Rack and I had a great time. I worked in both Accessories and Service Experience. I liked being on the floor and assisting people with making selections or giving advice on what would be better for them. But in Service experience, I liked having the constant interaction with customers while checking them out. Yes there were challenges, but overall, it was great working with other individuals who were goal driven and encouraging. ', " At first your led to believe Nordstrom really cares about their people, and wants to hear their thoughts. You quickly find out this isn't so. Management has there favorites, and in order to be seen you must kiss up. Doing your job isn't enough, your'e encouraged to NOT think out of the box.

My schedule would say 11:30 but I NEVER left on time, most of the time I would leave at around 1PM because we were either understaffed or doing unnecessary tasks that put us behind schedule. Literally, all of my coworkers (whom I loved dearly) on the stock team left before I did because our managers never really treated us with respect and hardly gave us recognition. We got put down more than anything. Personally, I was degraded by my managers and they weren\'t the most understanding people when it came to personal issues. If I asked a question about the work, I would get smart or sarcastic responses as if I was stupid for asking. They boast this "open door policy" and when my coworkers took advantage of this benefit and spoke up about issues going on, things were peachy for about 3 days and then back to the same ol\'.

I would merchandise new product onto the floor five days per week. All product received had to be out onto the floor so we were ready for business when the store opened. Once store was open we would start following up with any customers that needed to be taken care of as well as reaching out to new customers to set appointments for styling.

Nordstrom creates an amazing work environment which is relaxed and objective. Rapidly expanding company with plenty of opportunity for growth and promotion, but not within the store which I worked at.

I've always felt well compensated since day one and the benefits have continued to grow in my almost 4 years with the company. I'm grateful. ", " A typical day at Nordstrom is horrible. The managers that they hire for the position are not manger material. They do not listen to their employees unless you are friend , or if they like you.The mangers work you like crazy.

", " To be fair, this is the experience of a software developer, not someone in retail, so the perspective isn't the same for all of Nordstrom. They're trying to be a software company, and failing miserably. They are constantly shaking up management trying to get someone in who can deliver results in a time-frame expected by retail people (which is far to short for software development), and when it doesn't work they bring in new management. They are *far* more concerned about making sure your working hard than doing the right thing. And although they have good salary and benefits, the work environment is stifling (no walls anywhere, tiny desks, no privacy, and they're constantly re-arranging the layout of the floors). There's also only coffee to drink (not even any real creamer), and you have to pay to get anything else out of vending machines. ", " Overall Nordstrom is a fantastic place to work at. The culture is why people will stay a lifetime. Your customers and coworkers become family and are the inspiration to keep you motivated to always be better. The policies and upper management encourage your own critical thinking and problem solving to make the business your own. Of course there is stress and emotions when you work alongside commission and metric based roles ... it can take a lot out of your creativity and motivation. Isn't that most jobs? ", ' Nordstrom I can tell strives to hire people who are easy going and are open minded to working with a range of diverse groups. The one thing I love about working at Nordstrom is how diverse it is and how different departments still mingle together.  I currently work at the EBAR, so it is a little bit different than a traditional job at Nordstrom. Being at the EBAR it is impossible to get the opportunity to move up because the management would rather hire externally, than from the group of employees that already work there. This aspect would have to be the hardest part about my job.  I do enjoy making friendships and connections with the regulars that come into our coffee bar. That would be the most enjoyable part of my job. ', ' I started with Nordstrom in Dallas and it was a Dream job.

The structure of command is an inverted pyramid which shows that Customers are what keep the company alive and the employees on the front line, at the store level are most important. With that being said there is no structure for moving up within the company and you get different answers or the run around when asking for help. When I first started with the company no one explained about the benefits or where to go to find answers so I was in the dark a lot. The employees I work with are fun and I enjoy seeing them every day, however there are clicks within the company and a lot of gossip. I enjoyed wearing what I wanted to work and being able to adjust my hours to get off earlier. Everyone is positive and a team player. The technology they use, for example direct deposit comes in 3 days after your payday, is behind. ', " As a company, Nordstrom is a great company to work for. I've been fortunate enough to work with amazing people across many aspects of the company. Their employees are the number one thing the company has going for it.  Nordstrom IT, on the other hand, is suffering at the hands of change. There is little guidance, strategy or support from management. Today's IT leadership is rudderless. They do not seem to care about their employees. Work-life balance is out of balance. ", ' I had a great time working at Nordstrom...I was actually at the Rack and I had a great time. I worked in both Accessories and Service Experience. I liked being on the floor and assisting people with making selections or giving advice on what would be better for them. But in Service experience, I liked having the constant interaction with customers while checking them out.

My schedule would say 11:30 but I NEVER left on time, most of the time I would leave at around 1PM because we were either understaffed or doing unnecessary tasks that put us behind schedule. Literally, all of my coworkers (whom I loved dearly) on the stock team left before I did because our managers never really treated us with respect and hardly gave us recognition. We got put down more than anything. Personally, I was degraded by my managers and they weren\'t the most understanding people when it came to personal issues. If I asked a question about the work, I would get smart or sarcastic responses as if I was stupid for asking. They boast this "open door policy" and when my coworkers took advantage of this benefit and spoke up about issues going on, things were peachy for about 3 days and then back to the same ol\'.

Retail is long hours, and what is frustrating is the fact that Nordstrom's policy allows basically anything to be returned no questions asked, so your sales numbers go up and down frequently.

The one thing I love about working at Nordstrom is how diverse it is and how different departments still mingle together.  I currently work at the EBAR, so it is a little bit different than a traditional job at Nordstrom. Being at the EBAR it is impossible to get the opportunity to move up because the management would rather hire externally, than from the group of employees that already work there.

The most enjoyable thing about working at the Rack was being surrounded by the products coming in, and out of the stores, also building close knit relationships with fellow sales associates, since we had opened with that same store. Soon after opening the store, I became more aware of the culture and how management wasn't stable in keeping a reliable person in charge. I strongly felt that as a sales associate for this company it was a great title to have but short lived compared to the reality, of the culture.

They're trying to be a software company, and failing miserably. They are constantly shaking up management trying to get someone in who can deliver results in a time-frame expected by retail people (which is far to short for software development), and when it doesn't work they bring in new management. They are *far* more concerned about making sure your working hard than doing the right thing. And although they have good salary and benefits, the work environment is stifling (no walls anywhere, tiny desks, no privacy, and they're constantly re-arranging the layout of the floors). There's also only coffee to drink (not even any real creamer), and you have to pay to get anything else out of vending machines.

", " To be fair, this is the experience of a software developer, not someone in retail, so the perspective isn't the same for all of Nordstrom. They're trying to be a software company, and failing miserably. They are constantly shaking up management trying to get someone in who can deliver results in a time-frame expected by retail people (which is far to short for software development), and when it doesn't work they bring in new management. They are *far* more concerned about making sure your working hard than doing the right thing. And although they have good salary and benefits, the work environment is stifling (no walls anywhere, tiny desks, no privacy, and they're constantly re-arranging the layout of the floors). There's also only coffee to drink (not even any real creamer), and you have to pay to get anything else out of vending machines. ", " Overall Nordstrom is a fantastic place to work at. The culture is why people will stay a lifetime. Your customers and coworkers become family and are the inspiration to keep you motivated to always be better. The policies and upper management encourage your own critical thinking and problem solving to make the business your own. Of course there is stress and emotions when you work alongside commission and metric based roles ... it can take a lot out of your creativity and motivation. Isn't that most jobs? ", ' Nordstrom I can tell strives to hire people who are easy going and are open minded to working with a range of diverse groups. The one thing I love about working at Nordstrom is how diverse it is and how different departments still mingle together.  I currently work at the EBAR, so it is a little bit different than a traditional job at Nordstrom. Being at the EBAR it is impossible to get the opportunity to move up because the management would rather hire externally, than from the group of employees that already work there. This aspect would have to be the hardest part about my job.  I do enjoy making friendships and connections with the regulars that come into our coffee bar. That would be the most enjoyable part of my job. ', ' I started with Nordstrom in Dallas and it was a Dream job.

The structure of command is an inverted pyramid which shows that Customers are what keep the company alive and the employees on the front line, at the store level are most important. With that being said there is no structure for moving up within the company and you get different answers or the run around when asking for help. When I first started with the company no one explained about the benefits or where to go to find answers so I was in the dark a lot. The employees I work with are fun and I enjoy seeing them every day, however there are clicks within the company and a lot of gossip. I enjoyed wearing what I wanted to work and being able to adjust my hours to get off earlier. Everyone is positive and a team player. The technology they use, for example direct deposit comes in 3 days after your payday, is behind. ', " As a company, Nordstrom is a great company to work for. I've been fortunate enough to work with amazing people across many aspects of the company. Their employees are the number one thing the company has going for it.  Nordstrom IT, on the other hand, is suffering at the hands of change. There is little guidance, strategy or support from management. Today's IT leadership is rudderless. They do not seem to care about their employees. Work-life balance is out of balance. ", ' I had a great time working at Nordstrom...I was actually at the Rack and I had a great time. I worked in both Accessories and Service Experience. I liked being on the floor and assisting people with making selections or giving advice on what would be better for them. But in Service experience, I liked having the constant interaction with customers while checking them out. Yes there were challenges, but overall, it was great working with other individuals who were goal driven and encouraging.

Management has there favorites, and in order to be seen you must kiss up. Doing your job isn't enough, your'e encouraged to NOT think out of the box. My first year there was great, because they had a more caring management team, but as time went on people left, and new management just didn't care about the family business feel they were once fostering.

They're trying to be a software company, and failing miserably. They are constantly shaking up management trying to get someone in who can deliver results in a time-frame expected by retail people (which is far to short for software development), and when it doesn't work they bring in new management. They are *far* more concerned about making sure your working hard than doing the right thing. And although they have good salary and benefits, the work environment is stifling (no walls anywhere, tiny desks, no privacy, and they're constantly re-arranging the layout of the floors). There's also only coffee to drink (not even any real creamer), and you have to pay to get anything else out of vending machines.

Nordstrom creates an amazing work environment which is relaxed and objective. Rapidly expanding company with plenty of opportunity for growth and promotion, but not within the store which I worked at. Management within the Loss Prevention department created a difficult work experience via scheduling and negligence in training agents to become "released". Training process was not catered towards the individual which caused a lapse in training. ', " Nordstrom will take you through a series of lessons and education about the position. Management is pretty encouraging &amp; respectful. However, being that everyone is on high commission, its a pretty competitive environment. There are certain employees who will be very competitive and will do anything to sell the most. Retail is long hours, and what is frustrating is the fact that Nordstrom's policy allows basically anything to be returned no questions asked, so your sales numbers go up and down frequently. The sales goals are also very high. The employee discount is alright but nothing great. It really comes down to how competitive of a sales person you are and if you enjoy the retail commission atmosphere. ", ' Nordstrom is a great company, has room for growth and also a good starting job for any one interested in retail! working for the company i have learned how to work with others and take that experience to the next level of coaching others in the role ahead. one awesome fact is they make it easy to transfer across america and stay with the company! when it comes to management at Nordstrom there is a little brushing up to do, across the bored equality and appreciation everything the employee brings to the company. The hardest part of the job for me was the scheduling, effecting structure in your outside life and the work overload in some locations. Last but not least the most enjoyable part depending on location, the team work involved every day to drive numbers and always putting the customer first!

Everything was perfect: management, compensation, culture, etc. I was promoted quickly and eventually wanted to try something new in a different region. I chose the NE. Bad decision. Completely different caliber of people and culture. Just terrible. It broke my fervor for the company and my career within it. Had I chose a different region I would have probably been an employee for life. ', " Overall Nordstrom is a fantastic place to work at. The culture is why people will stay a lifetime. Your customers and coworkers become family and are the inspiration to keep you motivated to always be better. The policies and upper management encourage your own critical thinking and problem solving to make the business your own. Of course there is stress and emotions when you work alongside commission and metric based roles ... it can take a lot out of your creativity and motivation. Isn't that most jobs? ", ' Nordstrom I can tell strives to hire people who are easy going and are open minded to working with a range of diverse groups. The one thing I love about working at Nordstrom is how diverse it is and how different departments still mingle together.  I currently work at the EBAR, so it is a little bit different than a traditional job at Nordstrom. Being at the EBAR it is impossible to get the opportunity to move up because the management would rather hire externally, than from the group of employees that already work there. This aspect would have to be the hardest part about my job.  I do enjoy making friendships and connections with the regulars that come into our coffee bar. That would be the most enjoyable part of my job. ', " A typical day at Nordstrom is horrible. The managers that they hire for the position are not manger material. They do not listen to their employees unless you are friend , or if they like you.The mangers work you like crazy. My manger will give me eight tasks to do and it has to be completed by the end of my shift. My manger is not well organize and she does not know how to manage at all.

Compensation, healthcare, 401K,  employee stock purchases, are good. ", ' Typical day at work varied. There was alot of unorganization. Sales goals could be unattainable given the current seasons. I did learn about products and their uses. Management varied. Alot of politics involved. Promotions arent based on numbers and a persons sales. My coworkers were pleasant for trh most part. There is no job security. Benefits can be taken away at any given time for lack of hours but schedule is done "based on business". Not ideal for a person with real bills.

I've been fortunate enough to work with amazing people across many aspects of the company. Their employees are the number one thing the company has going for it.

I took so many lessons from working here, not just work lessons but life lessons.

My everyday goals here were to just be the best me i can be and let that shine to the customer. Which i was empowered to do each day. The area for advancement was also huge.

I enjoyed wearing what I wanted to work and being able to adjust my hours to get off earlier. Everyone is positive and a team player. The technology they use, for example direct deposit comes in 3 days after your payday, is behind. ', " As a company, Nordstrom is a great company to work for. I've been fortunate enough to work with amazing people across many aspects of the company. Their employees are the number one thing the company has going for it.  Nordstrom IT, on the other hand, is suffering at the hands of change. There is little guidance, strategy or support from management. Today's IT leadership is rudderless. They do not seem to care about their employees. Work-life balance is out of balance. ", ' I had a great time working at Nordstrom...I was actually at the Rack and I had a great time. I worked in both Accessories and Service Experience. I liked being on the floor and assisting people with making selections or giving advice on what would be better for them. But in Service experience, I liked having the constant interaction with customers while checking them out. Yes there were challenges, but overall, it was great working with other individuals who were goal driven and encouraging. ', " At first your led to believe Nordstrom really cares about their people, and wants to hear their thoughts. You quickly find out this isn't so. Management has there favorites, and in order to be seen you must kiss up. Doing your job isn't enough, your'e encouraged to NOT think out of the box. My first year there was great, because they had a more caring management team, but as time went on people left, and new management just didn't care about the family business feel they were once fostering. ", ' Nordstrom is a great place to work, especially as a starter job. They pay very well, and make you feel valuable. If retail is not your long term goal, I do not suggest falling in love with the company or you will find yourself for many years, and wondering where the time went. It is a great job to have while in school because they will work with your schedule regardless of how few hours you wish to work. ', " Nordstrom is a very established premium retail company based in Seattle Washington.   Very open and friendly workplace with  room for advancement depending on one's desires and abilities.   Compensation, healthcare, 401K,  employee stock purchases, are good. ", ' Normal day as a stockperson is coming in at 4:30 AM and leaving whenever the manager tells you to. My schedule would say 11:30 but I NEVER left on time, most of the time I would leave at around 1PM because we were either understaffed or doing unnecessary tasks that put us behind schedule. Literally, all of my coworkers (whom I loved dearly) on the stock team left before I did because our managers never really treated us with respect and hardly gave us recognition. We got put down more than anything. Personally, I was degraded by my managers and they weren\'t the most understanding people when it came to personal issues. If I asked a question about the work, I would get smart or sarcastic responses as if I was stupid for asking. They boast this "open door policy" and when my coworkers took advantage of this benefit and spoke up about issues going on, things were peachy for about 3 days and then back to the same ol\'. The company itself is great, though! Always did things for charity, potlucks, and when times got hard for me financially, they did help. ', ' Nordstrom is a major retail merchandiser with a successful presence in the North American market.  It is well designed and very well managed, as you would expect.  There is a commission policy in place to encourage sales staff but the sales threshold required for the policy to be enacted make it impossible to achieve.  There is the illusion of a fair compensation policy.  Benefits other than wages are good and encourage staff retention but you cannot live in Toronto on the wages earned. ', ' My schedule was generally  8 to 5 pm and two closing shifts per week. I would come into work and check sales from the previous day,assign goals and delegate tasks as needed. I would merchandise new product onto the floor five days per week. All product received had to be out onto the floor so we were ready for business when the store opened. Once store was open we would start following up with any customers that needed to be taken care of as well as reaching out to new customers to set appointments for styling. I would partner with the team to help sell in order to help their business as well as the departments. I learned that every person is different, you have to be able to work with that individual person, that people work for people. The reason I worked for Nordstrom was my customers and delivering great customer service. I also love to merchandise all the exciting new product. ', ' Typical day at work varied. There was alot of unorganization. Sales goals could be unattainable given the current seasons. I did learn about products and their uses. Management varied. Alot of politics involved. Promotions arent based on numbers and a persons sales. My coworkers were pleasant for trh most part. There is no job security.

Management is pretty encouraging &amp; respectful. However, being that everyone is on high commission, its a pretty competitive environment. There are certain employees who will be very competitive and will do anything to sell the most. Retail is long hours, and what is frustrating is the fact that Nordstrom's policy allows basically anything to be returned no questions asked, so your sales numbers go up and down frequently. The sales goals are also very high. The employee discount is alright but nothing great. It really comes down to how competitive of a sales person you are and if you enjoy the retail commission atmosphere.

Of course there is stress and emotions when you work alongside commission and metric based roles ... it can take a lot out of your creativity and motivation. Isn't that most jobs? ", ' Nordstrom I can tell strives to hire people who are easy going and are open minded to working with a range of diverse groups. The one thing I love about working at Nordstrom is how diverse it is and how different departments still mingle together.  I currently work at the EBAR, so it is a little bit different than a traditional job at Nordstrom. Being at the EBAR it is impossible to get the opportunity to move up because the management would rather hire externally, than from the group of employees that already work there. This aspect would have to be the hardest part about my job.  I do enjoy making friendships and connections with the regulars that come into our coffee bar. That would be the most enjoyable part of my job. ', " A typical day at Nordstrom is horrible. The managers that they hire for the position are not manger material.

Soon after opening the store, I became more aware of the culture and how management wasn't stable in keeping a reliable person in charge. I strongly felt that as a sales associate for this company it was a great title to have but short lived compared to the reality, of the culture.

They are *far* more concerned about making sure your working hard than doing the right thing. And although they have good salary and benefits, the work environment is stifling (no walls anywhere, tiny desks, no privacy, and they're constantly re-arranging the layout of the floors).
