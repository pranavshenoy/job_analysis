", " I am missing that place right now. In one word, simply Awesome. The company has a very good work culture that is maintained by the employees there. \"Respect for the individual\" is the keyword there. You will be respected for who you are and if you do have any problems, everybody is there to help. Its more like a family and it reflects in the job security as well. Accenture doesn't fire its employees unless its the only option left.   A typical day for an employee would start in the morning(although for some roles there are other shifts), but the idea is, you get instructions from your client(if you are in a role where you interact directly with the client, like how I was) or from your supervisor in your mailbox and you spend the rest of the day doing them. For any reason you end up not being able to do it by end of the day, just let your supervisor or client know and there are no issues. There is this laid-back culture in accenture, where you don't see supervisors or clients pushing you to do the tasks quickly. There are no points for how fast you do the work here. Its all about the quality. So, its okay to take your time, relax and do the work. The only case where you end up being under pressure is when a defect arises from the work you released. That pressure depends on the severity of the defect. Thats why its always best to take some extra time to check your work before delivering it.  If you are a person who likes to keep yourselves updated on the latest technology and  trends, then Accenture is the best place for you since they have this dedicated team who conduct ", "<span class=\"cmp-review-text\"> training sessions on a regular basis. If you want to learn something new, you can just register for an upcoming course(online and classroom based) and attend the same and its all free. Outside Accenture if you want to take up similar courses, you end up paying hundreds or even thousands of dollars.  Now, to get to work, accenture provides free transportation by means of buses and cabs. In case, you end up working in a shift where you can't use either of these, you can make your own arrangement and the company will reimburse you for the same when you bring in the bills. Every office has a 24x7 cafeteria facility to cater to needs of employees working in all shifts and there is also a good concierge service to help the employees for their personal errands.   The only con to the Accenture experience is the pay scale. They have this weird system by which a portion of your CTC is paid once every six months. This is the variable pay and forms a considerable part of your CTC. So, if you are living in a rented house, chances are that you might find what you get at the end of every month to be not as much as you expected. The CTC itself is a problem since Accenture has offices only in the big cities. So, if you ask me if the salary is good considering the living expense of these cities, I will have to say that its not. ", " Work starts from the evening 6 to morning 3 30.

", " A typical day at work started with looking at my mailbox as well as my HR Dashboard (one where requests and queries are auto directed to the respective HR) and formulating a to do list for the day by prioritising the tasks.  I then had various employee and line manager connects where I would interact with them face to face or anchor HR training programmes for them.  I would then look at the available employees and open roles within the organisation, screen their resumes and share their profiles with managers who posted the demands. For this, was responsible for North America based clients.  Further, I was responsible for transfers and thus had to ensure smooth domestic/ international transfers of employees.  I was also responsible for ensuring our team is compliant on the key performing indices. Thus had to review in detail our progress on each factor, prepare a bi-weekly report on the progress for the HR Manager.  Most weekends, I participated in open houses where pre registered candidates could come in for an interview. In this, I administered the aptitude test and took the HR interview round in addition to ensuring the applications were duly filled and all relevant documents were provided if the candidate were selected. I also had to ensure the line managers were filling out interview feedback forms comprehensively.  I learnt how to distinguish and prioritise tasks better to have an organised day and to keep track of what is pending. I also was able to hone my presentation skills and my interpersonal skills. Apart from learning to avoid failing at tasks, I realised ", "<span class=\"cmp-review-text\"> that owning upto them is equally important. I was also able to lead my team into consistently succeeding on compliance and other audit reports.    The Management at Accenture was very encouraging and lay emphasis on attending trainings beyond one's specific HR function. I thus was selected to be a part of the team that organised open houses and the team responsible for Employee Engagement at the work place.  My co workers over these four years have been supportive. Especially when in the first two years I was a management trainee and had classes and workshops to attend sometimes during office hours, they would willingly step in for me at work. Getting along in a team has never really been a challenge for me.    The hardest part of the job was the sheer volume of requests and knowing the fact that my action or inaction will impact both another individual and the organisation. I handled 65+ clients in terms of talent planning and had a span of 5,000 employees whose individual requests came to me.   The most enjoyable part was seeing an employee or a client realise their goals and to know that somewhere, my hard work contributed to it. These range from a transfer request, a role change request or a harassment complaint to Accenture's reputation staying intact before our clients since we were able to provide quality and on time solutions to their operational challenges. I also thoroughly enjoyed organising employee engagement activities such as 'Kids day at work', inter department football and cricket matches and team outings amongst several other activities.

Their is hardly any coordination between the HR/ management.  You need a WBS(Charge code) for anything and everything, you need  a notepad , you need to fill a form, email that , get that approved  and what not.  HR The HR is only for name sake, most of them sitting in a different city , you might work in noida and your HR in Banglore, if you are lucky and they are in the same city, they seldom hear you, even if you go to them with your grievances, dont expect them to help you coz only God knows what they remain busy with.

", " At Accenture, I work with Software Testing and Management tools such as Microsoft Visual Studio Team System (VSTS), HP Unified Functional Testing and HP Quality Centre. I interact with developers and make them understand the business requirement. I also give consultation on the Technical and Functional feasibility of a business requirement to Business Analysts. Understanding business requirements and delivering them with zero defects is the crucial part of my profession. This experience has aided me towards acquiring better decision making and management skills. To achieve technical expertise in Quality Management, I completed many industry and business level certifications, notably the International Software Testing Qualifications Board (ISTQB) Certified - Foundation Level and HP Accredited Integration Specialist Application Lifecycle Management V11 certified, amongst others. As I give consultation for business analysts it becomes important for me to understand what is the prospective of business analysis and so I joined the Accenture CIO Business Analyst learning forum where I learnt Business Analysis courses, Techniques for Requirement Gathering, Microsoft Test Manager (MTM) are a few to mention. And in this quest, I completed British Computer Society (BCS) - Information Systems Examinations Board (ISEB) Business Analysis Foundation Level Certification to supplement my knowledge of Business Analysis. I also attended in-house trainings on Offering of ERP Perspective, Data Warehouse Design Solutions, Problem Solving and Decision Making Strategies and Oracle Database 10g: SQL ", "<span class=\"cmp-review-text\"> Fundamentals.

In one word, simply Awesome. The company has a very good work culture that is maintained by the employees there. \"Respect for the individual\" is the keyword there. You will be respected for who you are and if you do have any problems, everybody is there to help. Its more like a family and it reflects in the job security as well. Accenture doesn't fire its employees unless its the only option left.   A typical day for an employee would start in the morning(although for some roles there are other shifts), but the idea is, you get instructions from your client(if you are in a role where you interact directly with the client, like how I was) or from your supervisor in your mailbox and you spend the rest of the day doing them. For any reason you end up not being able to do it by end of the day, just let your supervisor or client know and there are no issues. There is this laid-back culture in accenture, where you don't see supervisors or clients pushing you to do the tasks quickly. There are no points for how fast you do the work here. Its all about the quality. So, its okay to take your time, relax and do the work. The only case where you end up being under pressure is when a defect arises from the work you released. That pressure depends on the severity of the defect. Thats why its always best to take some extra time to check your work before delivering it.

If you want to learn something new, you can just register for an upcoming course(online and classroom based) and attend the same and its all free. Outside Accenture if you want to take up similar courses, you end up paying hundreds or even thousands of dollars.  Now, to get to work, accenture provides free transportation by means of buses and cabs. In case, you end up working in a shift where you can't use either of these, you can make your own arrangement and the company will reimburse you for the same when you bring in the bills. Every office has a 24x7 cafeteria facility to cater to needs of employees working in all shifts and there is also a good concierge service to help the employees for their personal errands.   The only con to the Accenture experience is the pay scale. They have this weird system by which a portion of your CTC is paid once every six months. This is the variable pay and forms a considerable part of your CTC. So, if you are living in a rented house, chances are that you might find what you get at the end of every month to be not as much as you expected. The CTC itself is a problem since Accenture has offices only in the big cities. So, if you ask me if the salary is good considering the living expense of these cities, I will have to say that its not.

", " Amazing Team and work is diverse and interesting! Accenture works in so many different areas an employee gains exposure to many different industries! ", " They talk a good game but unfortunately the best part about going to work for ACS is the recruiting experience, it's all downhill from there!  The epic and constant failure of Upper and Executive management is continual, they constantly fail to properly forecast and therefore the workers are left working 12-14 hour days.  Since ACS is a vendor to a very large bank in America, it will promise the world then work employees long hours to make it happen. I know the end of the month in the Mtg industry can be busy, but this place takes it to a whole new level.  'Just do it' seems to be a good motto for Nike, but in ACS language it means 'work this late and defective file, by the way, it's a same day closing'...  What's needed is work life balance but what we received was a remodeled lunch room in a leased building (oh - by the way, there went your bonus).  If a person tells the truth and refuses to 'drink the Kool Aid' and waive the company pom-poms, the chances of earning a promotion are slim, no matter how good you are, but don't worry, they promote their favorites and I was personally told by Exec Mgt. one person in particular they promoted was chosen because she would do as she was told, in other words she would never rock the established management team with great ideas and fresh perspectives.  ACS has a 36% turn over rate, exceedingly high even by industry standards; in my opinion, employee burnout, poor management, and working environment is the issue.  Some employees are motivated and offer great ideas, but I have seen great process improvement ideas not generated by ", "<span class=\"cmp-review-text\"> Upper Management ignored.  These ideas would have made a considerable impact in improving processes and environment.  The training is incomplete, (personally I received none) and because of the turnover rate, you have new people helping new people.. I had 3 managers in less than a year and watched adult professionals break down and cry at their desks.  Because HR is so afraid of offending anyone, weeding out the poor performers is a difficult and extensive process, frankly, it's easier to let them stay.  By the way, as a manager I was not able to hire my own people, they just showed up one day.  ACS' individual worker goals are in direct conflict with what is needed to be a successful company; they do not understand the difference between bonus and incentive. (they should be using the bonus to incent the behavior they want to drive)  There is no substantial reporting, and the number of support people (admin) to help build these reports and support the back end infrastructure is inadequate.    Lastly, there is very little accountability, so as work flows down the processing line it is often late and defective. You may get good at your job, simply because you are reworking files multiple times.  Do yourself a favor, either avoid this place entirely, or if you really need a job and get hired, start looking for your next career immediately.  I could go on and on but I feel you get the picture.

When you're in crunch time, you can also end up staying until Friday and sometimes even the weekend, but for me, that was the exception.

You know how every company says they have great people, or they value their unique culture? Bla bla bla. Accenture actually lives this.

The managers/leadership are just as great as your co-workers in my opinion. You can typically go to them for anything. Our hierarchy is pretty flat which makes leadership approachable. One more time - the PEOPLE are GREAT. I can count on one hand the number of people I did not like in 4 years, 5 clients, and 7 projects at Accenture.  However, when I say \"great people\", I'm not necessarily counting the clients / vendors you have to deal with on a daily basis. I would say this is the worst part of the job. Some are decent, intelligent, logical folk. 80% are not. The tough part about being a consultant is that you're put in the middle. You take the blame. You're not trusted. E.g. Client: \"What's this consulting firm doing coming in here telling me how to do my job?!\" And through all that, you have to produce top notch work and gain their trust and build a relationship with your client (even though they may hate you at first).  The last con is that we don't have the best annual performance system. It's not always fair or equitable. But I don't know how to fix it, so there you have it.

", " They talk a good game but unfortunately the best part about going to work for ACS is the recruiting experience, it's all downhill from there!  The epic and constant failure of Upper and Executive management is continual, they constantly fail to properly forecast and therefore the workers are left working 12-14 hour days.  Since ACS is a vendor to a very large bank in America, it will promise the world then work employees long hours to make it happen. I know the end of the month in the Mtg industry can be busy, but this place takes it to a whole new level.  'Just do it' seems to be a good motto for Nike, but in ACS language it means 'work this late and defective file, by the way, it's a same day closing'...  What's needed is work life balance but what we received was a remodeled lunch room in a leased building (oh - by the way, there went your bonus).  If a person tells the truth and refuses to 'drink the Kool Aid' and waive the company pom-poms, the chances of earning a promotion are slim, no matter how good you are, but don't worry, they promote their favorites and I was personally told by Exec Mgt. one person in particular they promoted was chosen because she would do as she was told, in other words she would never rock the established management team with great ideas and fresh perspectives.  ACS has a 36% turn over rate, exceedingly high even by industry standards; in my opinion, employee burnout, poor management, and working environment is the issue.  Some employees are motivated and offer great ideas, but I have seen great process improvement ideas not generated by ", "<span class=\"cmp-review-text\"> Upper Management ignored.  These ideas would have made a considerable impact in improving processes and environment.  The training is incomplete, (personally I received none) and because of the turnover rate, you have new people helping new people.. I had 3 managers in less than a year and watched adult professionals break down and cry at their desks.  Because HR is so afraid of offending anyone, weeding out the poor performers is a difficult and extensive process, frankly, it's easier to let them stay.  By the way, as a manager I was not able to hire my own people, they just showed up one day.  ACS' individual worker goals are in direct conflict with what is needed to be a successful company; they do not understand the difference between bonus and incentive. (they should be using the bonus to incent the behavior they want to drive)  There is no substantial reporting, and the number of support people (admin) to help build these reports and support the back end infrastructure is inadequate.    Lastly, there is very little accountability, so as work flows down the processing line it is often late and defective. You may get good at your job, simply because you are reworking files multiple times.  Do yourself a favor, either avoid this place entirely, or if you really need a job and get hired, start looking for your next career immediately.  I could go on and on but I feel you get the picture.

Accenture has the best implementation methodology but not the best people to leverage those tools. ", " This company is the old Andersen Consulting.  It is a huge global company which sells its services to a company then slowly shifts its operations to India, Brazil, or some other country where wages are extremely low. This allows for maximum profit.  The compensation and benefits are amazing, but you'll never have any free time to enjoy them.  You will be expected to work 60 hours/week (probably on the road) and if you work really hard, you'll be given Accenture's greatest compliment, you'll be \"meeting expectations.\"  That rating comes with no annual increase, no bonus and no hope of advancement.  The company likes to talk up their culture and uses terms like \"Team Building,\" \"Integrity,\" and \"Stewardship.\"  These are great as long as they don't stand in the way of the bottom line.  In the last year of my employment, I worked 100-hour weeks, had no life whatsoever, was on-call 24/7 and ran an account which generated $6,000,000.00 in annual revenue.  I was laid off when it was decided to move the day-to-day management of my account to someone in Bangalore, India.  This person had about six months of experience on the account and was paid a third of what I made.  Six months after I left, the client pulled the account and cited mismanagement.  The company lost a six million dollar account over $70,000.  My tenure there looks great on a resume, but it was a waste of time for my career. ", " I worked as a contractor under the AFS section.   Stability: Please note if you work as a contractor for AFS, much of budget and job stability resides on the federal side. They have cuts, even a contract cannot save your position. We had a 5 year contract, with an addendum to review every year, and I see why. They cut 10% of our project and although Accenture tried to place those 10%, they could not place everyone.   Career advancement: None as a contractor unless they promote you to a different position (one person did get promoted to a Direct Project Manager after one vacated the position)  Benefits: Benefits are awesome. I felt very compensated. Also, the additional benefits really made it seem like I was making more than I was.  Leadership: The leadership I had were all great. Very respectful and courteous, as well as trying to give praise. I appreciate that. However, I felt there was not enough leadership per personnel managed, so sometimes I believed them to be overwhelmed with emails due to slow response time. (For example, I believe each DPH had 55-75 personnel to manage for the project)   Overall, this is a great company. They handle things professionally and do their best to take care of their employees, which I believe was limited by the clients sometimes.  In the end, I left for more money, career advancement, and stability, which this position was unable to provide. ", " I'll start by saying Accenture is a great company. It seems to be well managed at the enterprise level, and the projects I've worked on tend to be staffed with and managed by very capable people as well. The work itself is not terribly exciting, but what would you expect from a company that makes its name implementing ERP solutions for most of its clients.  The benefits are great; you get more PTO then you'd probably ever need. And as long as you are respectful of your project's timeline when requesting to take vacation, few managers will deny the request. That said, the pay is underwhelming, and if you are promoted from within rather than an external hire, the raises are insulting.   Moreover, HR is truly awful. The company is continually realigning its workforce into groups with increasingly arbitrary names, which only have the effect of confusing its employees and limiting their ability to choose fulfilling roles. The company recruits many of its consultants on the promise of choice - that one they enter the general consulting \"pool\" they will be able to select roles that interest them. The reality is much different. The internal staffing folks were clearly sent from corporate h*** to plague the rest of the workforce. They have a specific purpose to align demand (hundreds of unfillable roles that promise unchallenging college freshman-level work) to supply (consultants who would prefer to have some say in their next role), and their existence alone is motivation to stay off the bench (unstaffed).

The epic and constant failure of Upper and Executive management is continual, they constantly fail to properly forecast and therefore the workers are left working 12-14 hour days.  Since ACS is a vendor to a very large bank in America, it will promise the world then work employees long hours to make it happen. I know the end of the month in the Mtg industry can be busy, but this place takes it to a whole new level.  'Just do it' seems to be a good motto for Nike, but in ACS language it means 'work this late and defective file, by the way, it's a same day closing'...  What's needed is work life balance but what we received was a remodeled lunch room in a leased building (oh - by the way, there went your bonus).  If a person tells the truth and refuses to 'drink the Kool Aid' and waive the company pom-poms, the chances of earning a promotion are slim, no matter how good you are, but don't worry, they promote their favorites and I was personally told by Exec Mgt. one person in particular they promoted was chosen because she would do as she was told, in other words she would never rock the established management team with great ideas and fresh perspectives.  ACS has a 36% turn over rate, exceedingly high even by industry standards; in my opinion, employee burnout, poor management, and working environment is the issue.  Some employees are motivated and offer great ideas, but I have seen great process improvement ideas not generated by ", "<span class=\"cmp-review-text\"> Upper Management ignored.  These ideas would have made a considerable impact in improving processes and environment.  The training is incomplete, (personally I received none) and because of the turnover rate, you have new people helping new people.. I had 3 managers in less than a year and watched adult professionals break down and cry at their desks.  Because HR is so afraid of offending anyone, weeding out the poor performers is a difficult and extensive process, frankly, it's easier to let them stay.  By the way, as a manager I was not able to hire my own people, they just showed up one day.  ACS' individual worker goals are in direct conflict with what is needed to be a successful company; they do not understand the difference between bonus and incentive. (they should be using the bonus to incent the behavior they want to drive)  There is no substantial reporting, and the number of support people (admin) to help build these reports and support the back end infrastructure is inadequate.    Lastly, there is very little accountability, so as work flows down the processing line it is often late and defective. You may get good at your job, simply because you are reworking files multiple times.

Also I became much more multitasking as I had to deal a wide range of matters, cultivating my sound judgement and the ability to manage the details whilst understanding the wider picture. My key responsibility of superior administrative support to the President, the Vice President and Senior Executives included preparation and handling of correspondence and other legal documents, logistics coordination, updating and maintaining of their calendars, as well as coordination and set-up of high-level conference calls.

Furthermore, I developed, formatted and maintained databases, drafted reports and edited and proofed materials and briefed presentations for Senior Executives, Senior Managers and Managers and prepared RFPs with high lever of accuracy and attention to detail within very tight projects.

Political and painful to push agendas through due to layers upon layers of approvals.  For internal projects, team size can escalate quickly to the point of inefficiency.  Increasing size and complexity can also make it difficult to find internal \"experts\" with answers...few people want to take accountability for their inputs.  Segmented operations perpetuates territorial mentality and pointing of fingers.    Their sense of \"fun\" seems engineered and artificial.  Not many people seem to truly enjoy their actual work (not a new phenomenon)...here, likely due to the overly critical approval process (opposite of collaboration), which strips away autonomy and trust.

The most enjoyable part of the job I do enjoy the team that I work with but that's about it. ", " I have been on several projects with Accenture with many recognized names such as Amtrak, Ralph Lauren, or MillerCoors. I have been in several roles, but the bulk of the work I do is related to SAP, specifically in SAP security. I have done more work on the testing and functional spaces, but most of my time has been on the technical teams for SAP implementation projects.  Typically I ramp up quickly to learn what I can when joining a new project. I then set to performing tasks to make the project successful and add value where I am able. For implementation projects, this consists of cutting down time to do tasks where applicable and conforming to timelines. For support work, it is trying to improve processes where I can and conforming to Service Level Agreements in the contract. Of course there is also a level of report that I build with my clients to make the flow of dialogue natural.  Accenture management, at least on the projects I have been on, has been good about managing the work load and giving good feedback when required. Co-workers are enjoyable to work around and everyone seems to be able to pull together, even in projects with tough aggressive timelines.  The hardest part of the job can be the workload. Sometimes we are required to work sixty or more hours in a week. These are rare occurrences, but tempers can flare on the client team and on the Accenture team in those situations.

Overall Accenture is a great company to work for with many platforms for career growth and development. ", " Your work day completely depends on the industry, client, and project you end up getting staffed on. This is actually a huge pro because you learn so much in such a short amount of time and have the opportunity to work with a wide range of people - vendors, client, and Accenture co-workers (not always pleasant, but you're exposed to a lot). This is why other companies LOVE hiring ex-consultants. Another perk: if you don't like your project - it will END. During my 4+ years I was on about 7 different projects. Some people will stay on a single project for years, but again, if you hate it, there are ways out.  Part of consulting is the inevitability of travel. Some people like it and some don't. There is always the possibility of working locally, but it's a toss up. Expect to fly in to your client location Monday morning and fly out Thursday afternoon/evening at the very least. When you're in crunch time, you can also end up staying until Friday and sometimes even the weekend, but for me, that was the exception. For me personally, my work/life balance was great and I liked the travel (oh! the airline miles! the hotel points! per diem! visiting another city!). During my travels, I also got to meet so many truly wonderful people, which brings me to my next point, the PEOPLE.  You know how every company says they have great people, or they value their unique culture? Bla bla bla. Accenture actually lives this. Our main resource is our people and I have made so many life-long friends working here. You end up with the most unbelievable network of co-workers, friends, and supporters. ", "<span class=\"cmp-review-text\"> Also, we like to go out and have fun. I traveled with co-workers all the time on mini-vacations, we did a ton of happy hours, sporting events, volunteer activities, etc. Whatever you like to do outside of work, you will find a group of people at Accenture who like to do the same thing. The managers/leadership are just as great as your co-workers in my opinion. You can typically go to them for anything. Our hierarchy is pretty flat which makes leadership approachable. One more time - the PEOPLE are GREAT. I can count on one hand the number of people I did not like in 4 years, 5 clients, and 7 projects at Accenture.  However, when I say \"great people\", I'm not necessarily counting the clients / vendors you have to deal with on a daily basis. I would say this is the worst part of the job. Some are decent, intelligent, logical folk. 80% are not. The tough part about being a consultant is that you're put in the middle. You take the blame. You're not trusted. E.g. Client: \"What's this consulting firm doing coming in here telling me how to do my job?!\" And through all that, you have to produce top notch work and gain their trust and build a relationship with your client (even though they may hate you at first).  The last con is that we don't have the best annual performance system. It's not always fair or equitable. But I don't know how to fix it, so there you have it. ", " Don't let them fool you, Accenture does do management consulting, and has been doing so for years. Accenture Management Consulting offers an almost overwhelming number of growth and learning opportunities.  Though its client-relationships aren't nearly as esteemed as those of the holy trinity - the M-B-B - it is trying - with success - to engage with its clients' c-suite on more than just matters of technology. This will only improve with time.  The management consulting practice's culture is - for the most part -congenial and collegiate. Senior staff tend to be approachable. Junior staff tend to be very type-A, and bright. The personality type people covet here is the \"Driver\" type - its underpinnings drive from the Systems and Technology practices. It is also surprisingly a conservative place (not politically) - management tends to be fairly risk averse, yet pro-innovation.  Compensation, annual raises, bonuses, and performance management go from bad to mediocre. The notion of pace-based promotions is eroding. This has a detrimental effect on everyone. Compensation, raises and bonuses - particularly for those who started years ago - is another terribly sore spot for most. The number of Senior Managers who have over 15 years of experience at Accenture, with Partner making revenues is scary and disappointing. The partner track seems like a distant dream. Career progression is very very difficult at milestone promotion points. Increased Value-based pricing deals - its rumored - will ultimately trickle down into employee compensation. However, I'm not holding my breath.  In summation, ", "<span class=\"cmp-review-text\"> it's a serious place that does serious work. Provided the emphasis on management consulting continues to be strong, I am bullish on it becoming not just a quality firm for its clients, but one for its employees. ", " Pros: Accenture is a great place for a recent college graduate or single adults who want to marry their career and travel a bit. There are opportunities to mold a career and even start a new career direction from scratch and Accenture provides the tools for you to do that.

There are also alot of great people in the organization, and for the most part you can work from home on Fridays.  Cons: Unless you are the loner type, who is ok with cosmetic relationships then this is not the place for you. The ability to establish friendships, or date is MAJORLY handicapped.

You will be in a perpetual state of on-boarding (getting badges, client ethics training, systems access, new passwords). You will encounter clients that hate consultants and that will be rude and mean, and you will have to put on a smile and enjoy the punishment since you are a guest in the building.

Their compensation package includes 24 days of PTO, but don't expect to be able to take all of them. Luckily, they will allow you to carry over that amount to the next year. In addition, the health benefits have gotten worse each year that I worked there, now requiring you participate in programs if you have undesirable (costly) traits, such as weight or smoking. Also be aware that you will be traveling every week, Accenture has several work / life balance programs but they cannot compete with coming home every day.

Uma grande escola de profissionais. Os benef\u00edcios concedidos, como plano de sa\u00fade, VT, entre outros s\u00e3o muito bons. J\u00e1 os sal\u00e1rios ficam um pouco a desejar. Passei este per\u00edodo na Accenture alocada no projeto Petronect, onde os primeiros meses foram no setor de help desk, com uma supervisora muito dedicada, uma grande l\u00edder que muito me incentivou. Como fui reconhecida atrav\u00e9s de elogios pelos fornecedores , auxiliando o at\u00e9 ent\u00e3o recente setor de cadastro a ganhar confian\u00e7a do cliente, ganhei oportunidade de ir para o setor de cota\u00e7\u00f5es, onde aumentei minha carga hor\u00e1ria de 6 para 8 horas di\u00e1rias, e  a rotina era um pouco mais pesada e estressante, por\u00e9m com o sistema JIT se aprende como \u00e9 realmente um trabalho em equipe. Neste sistema, passei alguns meses somente em contato com fornecedores, tratando demandas solicitadas pelas demais equipes e pelo cliente Petrobras.  Depois, fui para a equipe de PATEC (Parecer T\u00e9cnico), onde todas as d\u00favidas t\u00e9cnicas surgidas ou pela equipe de an\u00e1lise, ou pelos fornecedores, eram repassadas para os engenheiros (analistas), e tratadas antes de serem devolvidas ao solicitante. Por \u00faltimo , fui para a equipe de An\u00e1lise de cota\u00e7\u00f5es, onde tinha a responsabilidade de aprovar ou n\u00e3o, o pedido de compras para o cliente Petrobras. Atendia diversas unidades  como UO-BC, UO-AM, EPSERV, UO-RIO, entre outras.  Aprendi a analisar Relat\u00f3rio de cota\u00e7\u00f5es, classificar e desclassificar fornecedores na licita\u00e7\u00e3o, mediante avalia\u00e7\u00e3o de pre\u00e7os, condi\u00e7\u00f5es de entrega, prazos. Quando encontrava d\u00favidas referentes ", "<span class=\"cmp-review-text\"> ao que o fornecedor cotou, enviava para equipe de fornecedores tratar. Quando a d\u00favida era  de cunho t\u00e9cnico, enviava para tratamento com a equipe de Patec , e assim procedia, enviando o processo para equipe respectiva, quando a d\u00favida era tribut\u00e1ria, ou quando era algo a se tratar diretamente com o usu\u00e1rio (cliente), pois assim funciona o sistema JIT.  Toda a rotina da empresa \u00e9 feita utilizando ferramentas do SAP. A cultura empresarial \u00e9 algo que sempre me agradou. H\u00e1 uma aceita\u00e7\u00e3o e incentivo muito grande a profissionais de todos os credos, orienta\u00e7\u00e3o sexual, ra\u00e7a e estilos de personalidade. E isso \u00e9 sempre muito defendido dentro da empresa. "]]
