", " Deloitte Hyderabad- Good for freshers but not for experienced employees. Deloitte spoils you with all the goodies and benefits and makes you believe that you are working for a great company. As a result of this every fresher would say its a great company to work for however the problem is that they have not worked in any other company so they will understand the work culture. It is embedded in the brains of the freshers that Deloitte culture is the best and they tend to get used to it making them difficult to adjust in any other company or work environment. \"Learning\" and \"personal and professional development\" is a big problem. If you are talented, then prepare to undergo extreme office politics from your colleagues and vice versa.In fact most of the managers would encourage the same. In case your manager is an extremely \"learned\" personality with \"multiple degrees\" like CA, MBA, CFA or CPA then you can expect some good management in the team otherwise you are in trouble.Those kind of employees are preferred who would just listen and follow orders. In simple words - dont use your brain. Outsiders (experienced professionals) are not treated the same way as internal employees are treated and that is openly visible. I have 9 years of exp in three companies including 2 Big 4s and from what I have gone through, seen and heard from my friends in various departments in Deloitte - 'MOST' of the promotions happen based on your tenure at the firm and not on your talent as a result of which you end up working under people who are less talented than you. This creates insecurity and start ", "<span class=\"cmp-review-text\"> of office politics. Only few promotions are really genuine. Professional certification   \"is compulsory\" to get promoted to the Manager post in most of the departments even if you only do a \"copy and paste\" work. Also the designations in some departments are funny and do not have any importance in the job market. Most of the departments have individual contributor roles which means even if you are a senior or a manager you would end up doing a first level work. Individual contributor roles have good process management but lack in people management. Of course, the firm pays well, however it is entirely upto you if you want money and compromise other things or you want a good working environment and a good work culture. It is highly advisable to join Deloitte as a fresher (work only for a year max and get out) or join at a senior manager / Director post. Please give top preference to EY and KPMG prior joining Deloitte. Of course the brand name is great however brands are only created to attract customers which is \"you\".

If you do decide to work here, do it at your own risk.  But beware of:  1.  A non-existent onboarding process.  I was hired in June and was never given a job description or told what my specific duties were by my boss, who was always too busy.  I never had a proper sit-down as to what was expected of me despite multiple attempts to initiate one on my behalf.  I was always told \"yeah, we need to do that properly\" or some such nonsense but my boss never made it happen.  2.  Any HR personnel responsible for helping you move, especially if it's an international move involving a work visa.  My HR rep only worked 3 days a week, and when I had issues regarding the visa or relocation matters, tough luck if she was out of the office.  3.  If you're doing an international move, be prepared to spend thousands out of your own pocket to pay for things like the work visa, the NHS fee, and your flight over.

There is no support for new hires, and when sales go soft, non-GSAP is the first group to get cut...regardless of performance.   Further, the staffing process at Deloitte is AWFUL. As a new hire, you are expected to network your way into projects.  That would be all well and good if there were enough decent projects to go around, but there aren't. By my estimate, 80% of the work that Deloitte does is one step above staff augmentation - very little executive level interaction or strategic thinking.

", " Deloitte seemed like a great opportunity to grow professionally, but this company has been nothing but a huge disappointment. I strongly believe that is because of the department I am in and the \"leadership\" they have in place. Individuals that have been placed in Team Lead positions have zero to minimal call center experience. They do not implement or even know how to utilize call center metrics. They do not keep track of the reps work, i.e. amount of calls taken, number of tickets worked, ASA, AHT, etc. The company itself doesn't even know how to accurately calculate an agent's utilization rates because - wait for it - they've \"never done this before\". This creates an air of contention within the department. Since agents are not tracked or held accountable for the amount of work they do, there are inherently lazy individuals that take advantage of the lack of supervision. The reps with a solid work ethic are the ones that wind up picking up the slack, without any recognition. The head honcho has absolutely NO call center experience, which I was made aware of only after accepting the job offer. I'm pretty sure they gave him this department because he's been with the company for so long and was long overdue for a promotion. He's more concerned with bringing in additional clients than developing the staff he has on hand.The team leads are tasked with helping him create client presentations and offerings - which should be the department head's job, not theirs. As a young call center it is certainly essential that there is sufficient volume to remain relevant, but there is a serious ", "<span class=\"cmp-review-text\"> lack of management and the reps are the ones who suffer. Do not trust what they tell you about your schedule - they will say anything to have you accept the job offer. Get absolutely everything in writing, do not trust what they say during the job interview. If you have concerns regarding your schedule, remember that this is a 24/7 call center and your schedule WILL change. They don't care who works what hours or how much it affects your life at home. There is zero work life balance in this department and it is highly frowned upon if you do not work OT or come in if someone else calls out sick. Scheduling PTO is a complete farce. The team leads are so bad at scheduling that they continuously approve multiple reps for PTO that results in gaps of phone coverage, which is ultimately a breach in client contracts and negatively impacts SLAs. But they certainly can't tell you what their actual SLAs are since they don't maintain the call center metrics in any way. Also, the team leads and manager get every holiday off, while the reps do not. There are days that there are no managers or team leads on shift to provide support/oversight to the reps. They are off the clock every single day by 5PM at the very latest. The manager will not go to bat for you - the head honcho has surrounded himself with people that are essentially pushovers. It's either his way or the highway and the manager or any of the team leads will NOT stand up to him. The morale in the call center is extremely low and the lack of consideration for the employee's well being is ridiculous and frustrating. So if you want minimal pay, with decent benefits, with zero work life balance, please come here! Otherwise do yourself a favor and stay far away from this joke of a department.

In addition to this medieval tool, the company is split in different areas based on the targeted client, and moving from one to another is virtually impossible, making your opportunity to find a project very narrow. The more you go up, the more difficult it is to be \"billable\", with the result that each individual works for him/herself.  The utilization goal varies from up to 90% (consultants and lower levels) to 50% (directors and above), but it is given for granted that, no matter how high your utilization target is, you still have to dedicate an outrageous amount of time to Business Development, with the result that people use either client time, or work around the clock to keep up the pace and get burned out.

Long working hours. ", " I never imagined myself having a career in audit. No one in my immediate family had taken that route and coming out of high school, I knew very little about it.  My father, who has an accounting background encouraged me to apply which I did, with no real expectation of getting accepted into any firm.  On the 5th of January 2009 I started at Deloitte &amp; Touche - Zimbabwe. I also enrolled for a Bachelor's degree in Accounting Science with the University of South Africa in the same year, an institution which offers long distance learning/ correspondence. This enabled me to work full time at Deloitte and obtain my degree at the same time.  As you start off in the firm, the roles and responsibilities, as expected are small. The firm is structured in such a way that each team member receives on the job training which enables him/her to not only carry out the task assigned, but with each assignment, prepare him/her to one day run an audit engagement as the field senior, supervisor or manager.  The objective of each engagement is set out from the on-set, be it an assurance or agreed upon procedures engagement. I work in teams, from as small as 2 to as big as eight (8). Each individual has a role to play on the engagement to ensure the objective is achieved in the timelines set -  from planning the audit, carrying out substantive work, reporting and communications with management.  What does a  typical day at work entail? I am currently an audit senior at Deloitte and a typical day involves training the juniors on my team, review of their work, facilitating communications between ", "<span class=\"cmp-review-text\"> the client, my superiors and other service departments within Deloitte (e.g. Data Analytics, Enterprise Risk Services and Tax Department). I am also responsible for the review of financial statements prepared by the client. This requires a knowledge of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and International Standards on Auditing (ISAs).   Some people say audit it monotonous and very routine. From my five (5) years at Deloitte, I have realised that there are some mistruths to that notion. With the vast range of clients for which we provide audit services, our job cannot be monotonous and by no means boring. I have worked on mining, manufacturing, retail and not for profit engagements just to name a few.  From the exposure to various entities in different industries, I have obtained an appreciation of the way companies are run, the impact of economic, political, legal and social environments in which they operate. The highlight for me was going underground at a shaft mine and seeing how the ore is extracted. I have had the opportunity to be part of a plant tour of several beverage manufacturing companies in the client, privilege not open to the public.  As expected in any organisation, you work with people from all walks of life, with different philosophies and attitudes, but one with one goal in common - to become qualified chartered accountants at the end of the training contract. I have formed lasting relationships which some of my co-workers, who are concerned about my development people I can rely on for work, school and in my personal life.   The management at Deloitte has done a good job over the years in making sure that the goals of the firm and changes thereto are communicated to the staff appropriately. The partnership and management are approachable and have an open door policy which makes the work environment pleasant. I believe that a conducive work environment is of paramount importance in any organisation.   The hardest part about my job is being on an engagement where the client is not organised and as such does not conclude. Timelines and delivery is important as it is a measure of efficiency.  On the otherhand, what I enjoy the most is concluding an audit, adding value to the client through reports that we compile at the end of the engagement. I appreciate it when the juniors on my engagement give me feedback on what they have learnt on the engagement because it means they will go on to teach others.

Deloitte is great if you are just out of college and want to get experience - the learning and opportunities are second to none.

That way, they don't have to do the paperwork required to justify a higher-than-average annual rating.  My advice to anyone considering Deloitte is consider carefully everything being told to you by a Deloitte recruiter, then believe half.

For these new files which we call 'initial requests', I have to enter information on an internal database (Siebel), re-organize the file, scan and photocopy the declaration from the claimants (as well as marriage/death certificates) and send first request letters to the parties mentioned above- after they are signed.  Throughout the day I have to answer calls from claim management companies and claimants who would be inquisitive on what they need to do to help their claim be processed ASAP. I also receive post from the lenders and policy providers, so I link them to their file from my caseload cabinet.  On a daily basis I have a target of handing in 4 cases. A 'workable' case means that I have the information from the all mentioned parties and all the information re-confirmed from them matches with that provided by the claimant.

Interest rates and term of mortgage are the variables that you need to be really careful about as there may be slight discrepencies (which if picked up by the Claims Handling Unit=, would mean the case is returned). I am also judged on the quality of work, which each week has to be above 95%.  I am part of a team, whereby if we are unsure we ask each other questions and help each other out. Or if a team member is absent then we have to take care of their cases and make sure the chase cycle is followed correctly.  The management is ok, we just communicate if we need to book some time off work or if there are changes to the whole procedure.  The hardest part of the job is working around the clock as time flies by! For most of the day we can feel like we are on top of things but then come 16:00p.m., we can get a new bulk of work to do.
