The benefits for a full-time associate are comprehensive and clearly described, including 401K matching. Management is often seen wandering the sales floor and they wear the same aprons are the normal associates, meaning they end up helping customers just like the rest.

The hardest part of the job was dealing with insubordinate co workers who liked to goof off and not pull their weight. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers and product knowledge.

Expected to be checking emails and give your personal cell for contact on your time off. Very low salary/pay, benefits ok, but the bonuses are no where near what they promise.  No one I met has ever received the promised 25% even if they exceed sales plan. They don't fire people often so job security is pretty good but then you have to work with below par employees that should have been fired in their probationary period. Everyone is tired.  There is no work/life balance and this impacts the culture. It is a retail environment so most people are upbeat and ready to give good customer service which can look deceiving.  Look deeper and you will see the reality. ", ' Nice starting job if your straight out of High School and need to acquire some work experience.

You will also learn and gain experience in the culture of large, "Coporate America", where they love young, inexperienced but motivated people to munipulate and promote their business model and agenda. As for a working adult, they neither pay enough to support a family or give enough hours to take part in the great benefits that they offer.

They treat the lot associates poorly and overwork them, and hours can suck as most retail. However what sets them apart is the base salary which is higher than most, their flexibility with your life, sick and vacation time, as well as a wide variety of events and benefits.

As a supervisor you are expected to give your life to that place. It is a solid company to work for but typical Politics of most job settings unfortunately handwork doesn't speak for itself and that was frustrating. The benefits and 401k are great. The pay can be really good if you move through the system the right way such as certain departments and positions. If you stay in the same position raises generally aren't that great. Bonuses can be good if your store performs well and success sharing.

", " I loved working for the Home Depot,. It was a very hard working and exciting working environment. I met so many nice people and learned so many great tools that I could use in life. They have ongoing knowledge about so many household and daily life situations. I've been very fortunate to learn so much while I was there. The work team and management was extremely helpful and they were always willing to help with me if I didn't understand something. The Hardest part of the job would probably be taking on a question you are not familiar with. But my favorite part about the job was always being able to find someone who would help you find an answer or solution to a question you are being asked. ", ' Even as a normal departmental associate, there is always something to be doing. Maintaining stock and pursuing answers for customers are most of the day but there are also many smaller tasks plainly laid out each morning. Within a year, I had moved up to being a full-time associate and soon after to being a specialist, all by merely doing my best every day (and making sure management knew it). The benefits for a full-time associate are comprehensive and clearly described, including 401K matching. Management is often seen wandering the sales floor and they wear the same aprons are the normal associates, meaning they end up helping customers just like the rest. ', " Typical day at work involved standing long periods of time on concrete floor, management tended to hire very immature young employees who didn't want to work and had negative attitudes, and were rude to customers and co workers.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with insubordinate co workers who liked to goof off and not pull their weight. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers and product knowledge. The company was always having contest and competitions among employees which did not help with low moral issues. ", ' During a typical work day there are many, many opportunities to get to know fellow Associates, follow up on leads and Operations discrepancies, and seek out patrons wishing to take advantage of The Home Depot.  THD is a great place to work and has competitive wages &amp; benefits packages.  The hardest part of the job was trying to keep with all the wants &amp; needs of the position.

Luckily, a company cell phone and VPN allowed for a flexible schedule leading to greater results and increased work-life balance. ', ' Home Depot prides themselves on teamwork and communication. The main focus is always on keeping customers and staff happy. Great community to be apart of, and admirable devotion to being involved in their residential communities.

Customer satisfaction is guaranteed number one. ', " Other than the rotating door called management which never consists of the same cast you can learn a great deal and move up the internal hierarchy. They treat the lot associates poorly and overwork them, and hours can suck as most retail. However what sets them apart is the base salary which is higher than most, their flexibility with your life, sick and vacation time, as well as a wide variety of events and benefits. The biggest thing is they trust me to do my work and don't baby me or constantly check in on you. Great entry level job...just don't make a career out of it. ", " Iso loved working at the RDC. I loved how the coaches acted like friends to me. I'm always nervous at new places and everyone took me in. As long as you have the need for learning and love to work hard and not afraid of manual labor, this job is the greatest. The only hard part I found about this job picking up 5 gallon paint and unloading charcoal and broken pallets. That is it. The pay is so great, and the benefits are so wonderful.  All in all I would recommend this job to become a career for anyone ", ' I have loved my time with this company and do find that it is very enjoyable to work in most stores. I do find the pay to be a little low especially for those that take their own time to learn new skills and receive extra training to not receive a pay raise.  I will warn you that if you are part time (I am not) that hours for the most part are very limited through most of the year with the exception of holidays (off seasons you can get as low as 6 hours for the week to 18 hours). You also will not receive benefits if you are only part time.  The good thing is that they do work with school and child care situations as long as you have the paper work to back up your needs. ', ' Nice starting job if your straight out of High School and need to acquire some work experience. They offer a variety of skill sets from cashiers to sales and warehouse duties. You will also learn and gain experience in the culture of large, "Coporate America", where they love young, inexperienced but motivated people to munipulate and promote their business model and agenda. As for a working adult, they neither pay enough to support a family or give enough hours to take part in the great benefits that they offer. But, if your 18 and out of school, and can afford to invest in several years of doing the deeds that move you up the ladder, you can may be get to some type of management position, where you will then receive a decent wage. ', " I love working at the Home Depot RDC because there are a lot of opportunities to expand your skills and move up in the company.  It is always busy from day to day(except during the holidays where it tends to be slow). Probably the biggest thing you may have to overcome is the co-workers and their lack of attention to detail of the job requirements.  Outside of that, you get great benefits plus profit sharing bonuses every quarter and raises every year.  All you really need to do is do your job the way they require you to and show some ambition and you'll move ahead there. ", ' Environment was stimulating until poor quality began to seep into the management structure.  Compensation could have been improved also.  Compensation was not commensurate with worked performed and responsibilities assumed.  Felt highly esteemed by co-workers and customers alike, yet received just the opposite response from management.  Communication was way only and did not go uphill.  No feedback on submission of ideas to improve the company.  Praise rarely given.  Difficulty encountered in getting reimbursed for expenses.

When I first started there It was very hopeful and i was looking to grow, that idea quickly turned into a headache as I felt my management didn't have a a good grasp on how to maintain morale among staff (little to no recognition for achievements, constant negative critique), they practiced in favoritism (awards and promotions stayed within a particular circle) and it was very apparent to many of the staff. after awhile progression felt non existent no matter how much was put into the work. many times it felt as if our store didn't practice the Core Values that Home Depot preaches, but as I said my experience my particular store.

", ' Even as a normal departmental associate, there is always something to be doing. Maintaining stock and pursuing answers for customers are most of the day but there are also many smaller tasks plainly laid out each morning. Within a year, I had moved up to being a full-time associate and soon after to being a specialist, all by merely doing my best every day (and making sure management knew it). The benefits for a full-time associate are comprehensive and clearly described, including 401K matching. Management is often seen wandering the sales floor and they wear the same aprons are the normal associates, meaning they end up helping customers just like the rest. ', " Typical day at work involved standing long periods of time on concrete floor, management tended to hire very immature young employees who didn't want to work and had negative attitudes, and were rude to customers and co workers.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with insubordinate co workers who liked to goof off and not pull their weight. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers and product knowledge. The company was always having contest and competitions among employees which did not help with low moral issues. ", ' During a typical work day there are many, many opportunities to get to know fellow Associates, follow up on leads and Operations discrepancies, and seek out patrons wishing to take advantage of The Home Depot.  THD is a great place to work and has competitive wages &amp; benefits packages.  The hardest part of the job was trying to keep with all the wants &amp; needs of the position.

Luckily, a company cell phone and VPN allowed for a flexible schedule leading to greater results and increased work-life balance. ', ' Home Depot prides themselves on teamwork and communication. The main focus is always on keeping customers and staff happy. Great community to be apart of, and admirable devotion to being involved in their residential communities. Regular donations to Habit for Humanity and The Orange Door Project for youth homeless. Associates are encouraged and expected to strive to learn more and take charge. Customer satisfaction is guaranteed number one. ', " Other than the rotating door called management which never consists of the same cast you can learn a great deal and move up the internal hierarchy. They treat the lot associates poorly and overwork them, and hours can suck as most retail. However what sets them apart is the base salary which is higher than most, their flexibility with your life, sick and vacation time, as well as a wide variety of events and benefits. The biggest thing is they trust me to do my work and don't baby me or constantly check in on you. Great entry level job...just don't make a career out of it. ", " Iso loved working at the RDC. I loved how the coaches acted like friends to me. I'm always nervous at new places and everyone took me in. As long as you have the need for learning and love to work hard and not afraid of manual labor, this job is the greatest. The only hard part I found about this job picking up 5 gallon paint and unloading charcoal and broken pallets. That is it. The pay is so great, and the benefits are so wonderful.  All in all I would recommend this job to become a career for anyone ", ' I have loved my time with this company and do find that it is very enjoyable to work in most stores. I do find the pay to be a little low especially for those that take their own time to learn new skills and receive extra training to not receive a pay raise.  I will warn you that if you are part time (I am not) that hours for the most part are very limited through most of the year with the exception of holidays (off seasons you can get as low as 6 hours for the week to 18 hours). You also will not receive benefits if you are only part time.  The good thing is that they do work with school and child care situations as long as you have the paper work to back up your needs. ', ' Nice starting job if your straight out of High School and need to acquire some work experience. They offer a variety of skill sets from cashiers to sales and warehouse duties. You will also learn and gain experience in the culture of large, "Coporate America", where they love young, inexperienced but motivated people to munipulate and promote their business model and agenda. As for a working adult, they neither pay enough to support a family or give enough hours to take part in the great benefits that they offer. But, if your 18 and out of school, and can afford to invest in several years of doing the deeds that move you up the ladder, you can may be get to some type of management position, where you will then receive a decent wage. ', " I love working at the Home Depot RDC because there are a lot of opportunities to expand your skills and move up in the company.  It is always busy from day to day(except during the holidays where it tends to be slow). Probably the biggest thing you may have to overcome is the co-workers and their lack of attention to detail of the job requirements.  Outside of that, you get great benefits plus profit sharing bonuses every quarter and raises every year.  All you really need to do is do your job the way they require you to and show some ambition and you'll move ahead there. ", ' Environment was stimulating until poor quality began to seep into the management structure.  Compensation could have been improved also.  Compensation was not commensurate with worked performed and responsibilities assumed.  Felt highly esteemed by co-workers and customers alike, yet received just the opposite response from management.  Communication was way only and did not go uphill.  No feedback on submission of ideas to improve the company.  Praise rarely given.  Difficulty encountered in getting reimbursed for expenses. ', " overall HD is a good company but I can only Speak on my experience with my own store. When I first started there It was very hopeful and i was looking to grow, that idea quickly turned into a headache as I felt my management didn't have a a good grasp on how to maintain morale among staff (little to no recognition for achievements, constant negative critique), they practiced in favoritism (awards and promotions stayed within a particular circle) and it was very apparent to many of the staff. after awhile progression felt non existent no matter how much was put into the work. many times it felt as if our store didn't practice the Core Values that Home Depot preaches, but as I said my experience my particular store.

I will warn you that if you are part time (I am not) that hours for the most part are very limited through most of the year with the exception of holidays (off seasons you can get as low as 6 hours for the week to 18 hours).

As for a working adult, they neither pay enough to support a family or give enough hours to take part in the great benefits that they offer.

It is always busy from day to day(except during the holidays where it tends to be slow). Probably the biggest thing you may have to overcome is the co-workers and their lack of attention to detail of the job requirements.  Outside of that, you get great benefits plus profit sharing bonuses every quarter and raises every year.  All you really need to do is do your job the way they require you to and show some ambition and you'll move ahead there.

As a supervisor you are expected to give your life to that place. It is a solid company to work for but typical Politics of most job settings unfortunately handwork doesn't speak for itself and that was frustrating. The benefits and 401k are great. The pay can be really good if you move through the system the right way such as certain departments and positions. If you stay in the same position raises generally aren't that great. Bonuses can be good if your store performs well and success sharing.

They have ongoing knowledge about so many household and daily life situations. I've been very fortunate to learn so much while I was there. The work team and management was extremely helpful and they were always willing to help with me if I didn't understand something. The Hardest part of the job would probably be taking on a question you are not familiar with. But my favorite part about the job was always being able to find someone who would help you find an answer or solution to a question you are being asked. ", ' Even as a normal departmental associate, there is always something to be doing. Maintaining stock and pursuing answers for customers are most of the day but there are also many smaller tasks plainly laid out each morning. Within a year, I had moved up to being a full-time associate and soon after to being a specialist, all by merely doing my best every day (and making sure management knew it). The benefits for a full-time associate are comprehensive and clearly described, including 401K matching. Management is often seen wandering the sales floor and they wear the same aprons are the normal associates, meaning they end up helping customers just like the rest. ', " Typical day at work involved standing long periods of time on concrete floor, management tended to hire very immature young employees who didn't want to work and had negative attitudes, and were rude to customers and co workers.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with insubordinate co workers who liked to goof off and not pull their weight. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers and product knowledge. The company was always having contest and competitions among employees which did not help with low moral issues.

THD is a great place to work and has competitive wages &amp; benefits packages.  The hardest part of the job was trying to keep with all the wants &amp; needs of the position.

', " Other than the rotating door called management which never consists of the same cast you can learn a great deal and move up the internal hierarchy. They treat the lot associates poorly and overwork them, and hours can suck as most retail. However what sets them apart is the base salary which is higher than most, their flexibility with your life, sick and vacation time, as well as a wide variety of events and benefits. The biggest thing is they trust me to do my work and don't baby me or constantly check in on you. Great entry level job...just don't make a career out of it. ", " Iso loved working at the RDC. I loved how the coaches acted like friends to me. I'm always nervous at new places and everyone took me in. As long as you have the need for learning and love to work hard and not afraid of manual labor, this job is the greatest. The only hard part I found about this job picking up 5 gallon paint and unloading charcoal and broken pallets. That is it. The pay is so great, and the benefits are so wonderful.  All in all I would recommend this job to become a career for anyone ", ' I have loved my time with this company and do find that it is very enjoyable to work in most stores. I do find the pay to be a little low especially for those that take their own time to learn new skills and receive extra training to not receive a pay raise.  I will warn you that if you are part time (I am not) that hours for the most part are very limited through most of the year with the exception of holidays (off seasons you can get as low as 6 hours for the week to 18 hours). You also will not receive benefits if you are only part time.  The good thing is that they do work with school and child care situations as long as you have the paper work to back up your needs. ', ' Nice starting job if your straight out of High School and need to acquire some work experience. They offer a variety of skill sets from cashiers to sales and warehouse duties. You will also learn and gain experience in the culture of large, "Coporate America", where they love young, inexperienced but motivated people to munipulate and promote their business model and agenda. As for a working adult, they neither pay enough to support a family or give enough hours to take part in the great benefits that they offer. But, if your 18 and out of school, and can afford to invest in several years of doing the deeds that move you up the ladder, you can may be get to some type of management position, where you will then receive a decent wage. ', " I love working at the Home Depot RDC because there are a lot of opportunities to expand your skills and move up in the company.  It is always busy from day to day(except during the holidays where it tends to be slow). Probably the biggest thing you may have to overcome is the co-workers and their lack of attention to detail of the job requirements.  Outside of that, you get great benefits plus profit sharing bonuses every quarter and raises every year.  All you really need to do is do your job the way they require you to and show some ambition and you'll move ahead there. ", ' Environment was stimulating until poor quality began to seep into the management structure.  Compensation could have been improved also.  Compensation was not commensurate with worked performed and responsibilities assumed.  Felt highly esteemed by co-workers and customers alike, yet received just the opposite response from management.  Communication was way only and did not go uphill.

When I first started there It was very hopeful and i was looking to grow, that idea quickly turned into a headache as I felt my management didn't have a a good grasp on how to maintain morale among staff (little to no recognition for achievements, constant negative critique), they practiced in favoritism (awards and promotions stayed within a particular circle) and it was very apparent to many of the staff. after awhile progression felt non existent no matter how much was put into the work. many times it felt as if our store didn't practice the Core Values that Home Depot preaches, but as I said my experience my particular store.

In that time I have experienced just about everything one can experience in a retail environment from good to bad.  That being said, Home Depot does indeed care about their associates and customers.

Then when your released to the floor the expectation is that you know what you're doing and should do as they say and not as they do.  There is constant contradiction between corporate policy and store policy.  Don't fall on the wrong side of the haves and have-nots, you are quickly relinquished of your services.

As a supervisor you are expected to give your life to that place. It is a solid company to work for but typical Politics of most job settings unfortunately handwork doesn't speak for itself and that was frustrating. The benefits and 401k are great. The pay can be really good if you move through the system the right way such as certain departments and positions. If you stay in the same position raises generally aren't that great. Bonuses can be good if your store performs well and success sharing.

They have ongoing knowledge about so many household and daily life situations. I've been very fortunate to learn so much while I was there. The work team and management was extremely helpful and they were always willing to help with me if I didn't understand something. The Hardest part of the job would probably be taking on a question you are not familiar with. But my favorite part about the job was always being able to find someone who would help you find an answer or solution to a question you are being asked. ", ' Even as a normal departmental associate, there is always something to be doing. Maintaining stock and pursuing answers for customers are most of the day but there are also many smaller tasks plainly laid out each morning. Within a year, I had moved up to being a full-time associate and soon after to being a specialist, all by merely doing my best every day (and making sure management knew it). The benefits for a full-time associate are comprehensive and clearly described, including 401K matching. Management is often seen wandering the sales floor and they wear the same aprons are the normal associates, meaning they end up helping customers just like the rest. ', " Typical day at work involved standing long periods of time on concrete floor, management tended to hire very immature young employees who didn't want to work and had negative attitudes, and were rude to customers and co workers.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with insubordinate co workers who liked to goof off and not pull their weight. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers and product knowledge. The company was always having contest and competitions among employees which did not help with low moral issues. ", ' During a typical work day there are many, many opportunities to get to know fellow Associates, follow up on leads and Operations discrepancies, and seek out patrons wishing to take advantage of The Home Depot.  THD is a great place to work and has competitive wages &amp; benefits packages.  The hardest part of the job was trying to keep with all the wants &amp; needs of the position.

Luckily, a company cell phone and VPN allowed for a flexible schedule leading to greater results and increased work-life balance. ', ' Home Depot prides themselves on teamwork and communication.

Customer satisfaction is guaranteed number one. ', " Other than the rotating door called management which never consists of the same cast you can learn a great deal and move up the internal hierarchy. They treat the lot associates poorly and overwork them, and hours can suck as most retail. However what sets them apart is the base salary which is higher than most, their flexibility with your life, sick and vacation time, as well as a wide variety of events and benefits. The biggest thing is they trust me to do my work and don't baby me or constantly check in on you. Great entry level job...just don't make a career out of it. ", " Iso loved working at the RDC. I loved how the coaches acted like friends to me. I'm always nervous at new places and everyone took me in. As long as you have the need for learning and love to work hard and not afraid of manual labor, this job is the greatest. The only hard part I found about this job picking up 5 gallon paint and unloading charcoal and broken pallets. That is it. The pay is so great, and the benefits are so wonderful.  All in all I would recommend this job to become a career for anyone ", ' I have loved my time with this company and do find that it is very enjoyable to work in most stores. I do find the pay to be a little low especially for those that take their own time to learn new skills and receive extra training to not receive a pay raise.  I will warn you that if you are part time (I am not) that hours for the most part are very limited through most of the year with the exception of holidays (off seasons you can get as low as 6 hours for the week to 18 hours). You also will not receive benefits if you are only part time.  The good thing is that they do work with school and child care situations as long as you have the paper work to back up your needs. ', ' Nice starting job if your straight out of High School and need to acquire some work experience. They offer a variety of skill sets from cashiers to sales and warehouse duties. You will also learn and gain experience in the culture of large, "Coporate America", where they love young, inexperienced but motivated people to munipulate and promote their business model and agenda. As for a working adult, they neither pay enough to support a family or give enough hours to take part in the great benefits that they offer. But, if your 18 and out of school, and can afford to invest in several years of doing the deeds that move you up the ladder, you can may be get to some type of management position, where you will then receive a decent wage. ', " I love working at the Home Depot RDC because there are a lot of opportunities to expand your skills and move up in the company.  It is always busy from day to day(except during the holidays where it tends to be slow). Probably the biggest thing you may have to overcome is the co-workers and their lack of attention to detail of the job requirements.  Outside of that, you get great benefits plus profit sharing bonuses every quarter and raises every year.  All you really need to do is do your job the way they require you to and show some ambition and you'll move ahead there. ", ' Environment was stimulating until poor quality began to seep into the management structure.  Compensation could have been improved also.  Compensation was not commensurate with worked performed and responsibilities assumed.  Felt highly esteemed by co-workers and customers alike, yet received just the opposite response from management.  Communication was way only and did not go uphill.  No feedback on submission of ideas to improve the company.  Praise rarely given.  Difficulty encountered in getting reimbursed for expenses.

When I first started there It was very hopeful and i was looking to grow, that idea quickly turned into a headache as I felt my management didn't have a a good grasp on how to maintain morale among staff (little to no recognition for achievements, constant negative critique), they practiced in favoritism (awards and promotions stayed within a particular circle) and it was very apparent to many of the staff. after awhile progression felt non existent no matter how much was put into the work. many times it felt as if our store didn't practice the Core Values that Home Depot preaches, but as I said my experience my particular store.

When I first started there It was very hopeful and i was looking to grow, that idea quickly turned into a headache as I felt my management didn't have a a good grasp on how to maintain morale among staff (little to no recognition for achievements, constant negative critique), they practiced in favoritism (awards and promotions stayed within a particular circle) and it was very apparent to many of the staff. after awhile progression felt non existent no matter how much was put into the work. many times it felt as if our store didn't practice the Core Values that Home Depot preaches, but as I said my experience my particular store.

The pay can be really good if you move through the system the right way such as certain departments and positions. If you stay in the same position raises generally aren't that great.

All in all I would recommend this job to become a career for anyone ", " Home Depot culture is not what it protrays, I think they have to many bosses and not enough workers.

The work team and management was extremely helpful and they were always willing to help with me if I didn't understand something.

', ' Even as a normal departmental associate, there is always something to be doing. Maintaining stock and pursuing answers for customers are most of the day but there are also many smaller tasks plainly laid out each morning. Within a year, I had moved up to being a full-time associate and soon after to being a specialist, all by merely doing my best every day (and making sure management knew it). The benefits for a full-time associate are comprehensive and clearly described, including 401K matching. Management is often seen wandering the sales floor and they wear the same aprons are the normal associates, meaning they end up helping customers just like the rest. ', " Typical day at work involved standing long periods of time on concrete floor, management tended to hire very immature young employees who didn't want to work and had negative attitudes, and were rude to customers and co workers.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with insubordinate co workers who liked to goof off and not pull their weight. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers and product knowledge. The company was always having contest and competitions among employees which did not help with low moral issues.

Luckily, a company cell phone and VPN allowed for a flexible schedule leading to greater results and increased work-life balance. ', " Continually expected to work 10 to 12 hours per day, they claim they don't but they schedule you for mandatory meetings that extend your day. Expected to be checking emails and give your personal cell for contact on your time off. Very low salary/pay, benefits ok, but the bonuses are no where near what they promise.  No one I met has ever received the promised 25% even if they exceed sales plan. They don't fire people often so job security is pretty good but then you have to work with below par employees that should have been fired in their probationary period. Everyone is tired.  There is no work/life balance and this impacts the culture. It is a retail environment so most people are upbeat and ready to give good customer service which can look deceiving.  Look deeper and you will see the reality. ", ' Nice starting job if your straight out of High School and need to acquire some work experience. They offer a variety of skill sets from cashiers to sales and warehouse duties. You will also learn and gain experience in the culture of large, "Coporate America", where they love young, inexperienced but motivated people to munipulate and promote their business model and agenda. As for a working adult, they neither pay enough to support a family or give enough hours to take part in the great benefits that they offer. But, if your 18 and out of school, and can afford to invest in several years of doing the deeds that move you up the ladder, you can may be get to some type of management position, where you will then receive a decent wage. ', " Other than the rotating door called management which never consists of the same cast you can learn a great deal and move up the internal hierarchy. They treat the lot associates poorly and overwork them, and hours can suck as most retail. However what sets them apart is the base salary which is higher than most, their flexibility with your life, sick and vacation time, as well as a wide variety of events and benefits. The biggest thing is they trust me to do my work and don't baby me or constantly check in on you. Great entry level job...just don't make a career out of it.

I do find the pay to be a little low especially for those that take their own time to learn new skills and receive extra training to not receive a pay raise.  I will warn you that if you are part time (I am not) that hours for the most part are very limited through most of the year with the exception of holidays (off seasons you can get as low as 6 hours for the week to 18 hours).

The pay can be really good if you move through the system the right way such as certain departments and positions. If you stay in the same position raises generally aren't that great. Bonuses can be good if your store performs well and success sharing.  If you are offered the opportunity to get training in ATL that was the best part of my time with the company, great and beneficial experience. As with any job there are pros and cons.

The work team and management was extremely helpful and they were always willing to help with me if I didn't understand something.

Maintaining stock and pursuing answers for customers are most of the day but there are also many smaller tasks plainly laid out each morning. Within a year, I had moved up to being a full-time associate and soon after to being a specialist, all by merely doing my best every day (and making sure management knew it). The benefits for a full-time associate are comprehensive and clearly described, including 401K matching. Management is often seen wandering the sales floor and they wear the same aprons are the normal associates, meaning they end up helping customers just like the rest.

I do find the pay to be a little low especially for those that take their own time to learn new skills and receive extra training to not receive a pay raise.  I will warn you that if you are part time (I am not) that hours for the most part are very limited through most of the year with the exception of holidays (off seasons you can get as low as 6 hours for the week to 18 hours). You also will not receive benefits if you are only part time.  The good thing is that they do work with school and child care situations as long as you have the paper work to back up your needs.

You will also learn and gain experience in the culture of large, "Coporate America", where they love young, inexperienced but motivated people to munipulate and promote their business model and agenda. As for a working adult, they neither pay enough to support a family or give enough hours to take part in the great benefits that they offer. But, if your 18 and out of school, and can afford to invest in several years of doing the deeds that move you up the ladder, you can may be get to some type of management position, where you will then receive a decent wage. ', " I love working at the Home Depot RDC because there are a lot of opportunities to expand your skills and move up in the company.  It is always busy from day to day(except during the holidays where it tends to be slow). Probably the biggest thing you may have to overcome is the co-workers and their lack of attention to detail of the job requirements.  Outside of that, you get great benefits plus profit sharing bonuses every quarter and raises every year.  All you really need to do is do your job the way they require you to and show some ambition and you'll move ahead there.

In that time I have experienced just about everything one can experience in a retail environment from good to bad.  That being said, Home Depot does indeed care about their associates and customers.

There is a network there that is impenetrable.  Training was horrible. They sit you in a room with no human interaction. It's strictly computer based for one week.  Then when your released to the floor the expectation is that you know what you're doing and should do as they say and not as they do.  There is constant contradiction between corporate policy and store policy.  Don't fall on the wrong side of the haves and have-nots, you are quickly relinquished of your services.

As for a working adult, they neither pay enough to support a family or give enough hours to take part in the great benefits that they offer.

Probably the biggest thing you may have to overcome is the co-workers and their lack of attention to detail of the job requirements.  Outside of that, you get great benefits plus profit sharing bonuses every quarter and raises every year.

You also will not receive benefits if you are only part time.  The good thing is that they do work with school and child care situations as long as you have the paper work to back up your needs.

The pay can be really good if you move through the system the right way such as certain departments and positions. If you stay in the same position raises generally aren't that great.

The benefits for a full-time associate are comprehensive and clearly described, including 401K matching. Management is often seen wandering the sales floor and they wear the same aprons are the normal associates, meaning they end up helping customers just like the rest.

The hardest part of the job was dealing with insubordinate co workers who liked to goof off and not pull their weight.

As for a working adult, they neither pay enough to support a family or give enough hours to take part in the great benefits that they offer.

Expected to be checking emails and give your personal cell for contact on your time off. Very low salary/pay, benefits ok, but the bonuses are no where near what they promise.  No one I met has ever received the promised 25% even if they exceed sales plan. They don't fire people often so job security is pretty good but then you have to work with below par employees that should have been fired in their probationary period. Everyone is tired.  There is no work/life balance and this impacts the culture. It is a retail environment so most people are upbeat and ready to give good customer service which can look deceiving.  Look deeper and you will see the reality. ", ' Nice starting job if your straight out of High School and need to acquire some work experience.

It is a solid company to work for but typical Politics of most job settings unfortunately handwork doesn't speak for itself and that was frustrating. The benefits and 401k are great. The pay can be really good if you move through the system the right way such as certain departments and positions. If you stay in the same position raises generally aren't that great. Bonuses can be good if your store performs well and success sharing.  If you are offered the opportunity to get training in ATL that was the best part of my time with the company, great and beneficial experience. As with any job there are pros and cons. ", " Iso loved working at the RDC. I loved how the coaches acted like friends to me. I'm always nervous at new places and everyone took me in. As long as you have the need for learning and love to work hard and not afraid of manual labor, this job is the greatest. The only hard part I found about this job picking up 5 gallon paint and unloading charcoal and broken pallets. That is it. The pay is so great, and the benefits are so wonderful.  All in all I would recommend this job to become a career for anyone ", " Home Depot culture is not what it protrays, I think they have to many bosses and not enough workers.  The employees work hard but are not appreciated.  Employees work only part time with no benefits which how Home Depot doesn't  have to pay medical benefit.  The employees that I worked with were dedicated to Home Depot but were not appreciated like they should of been.    I was with Home Depot a short time and I did enjoy my job but management as a whole needed to be revamp from the top down and get back to basic and learn to really see how there employees work hard for Home Depot. ", " I loved working for the Home Depot,. It was a very hard working and exciting working environment. I met so many nice people and learned so many great tools that I could use in life. They have ongoing knowledge about so many household and daily life situations. I've been very fortunate to learn so much while I was there. The work team and management was extremely helpful and they were always willing to help with me if I didn't understand something. The Hardest part of the job would probably be taking on a question you are not familiar with. But my favorite part about the job was always being able to find someone who would help you find an answer or solution to a question you are being asked. ", ' Home Depot prides themselves on teamwork and communication. The main focus is always on keeping customers and staff happy. Great community to be apart of, and admirable devotion to being involved in their residential communities. Regular donations to Habit for Humanity and The Orange Door Project for youth homeless. Associates are encouraged and expected to strive to learn more and take charge. Customer satisfaction is guaranteed number one. ', ' Even as a normal departmental associate, there is always something to be doing. Maintaining stock and pursuing answers for customers are most of the day but there are also many smaller tasks plainly laid out each morning. Within a year, I had moved up to being a full-time associate and soon after to being a specialist, all by merely doing my best every day (and making sure management knew it). The benefits for a full-time associate are comprehensive and clearly described, including 401K matching. Management is often seen wandering the sales floor and they wear the same aprons are the normal associates, meaning they end up helping customers just like the rest. ', " Typical day at work involved standing long periods of time on concrete floor, management tended to hire very immature young employees who didn't want to work and had negative attitudes, and were rude to customers and co workers.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with insubordinate co workers who liked to goof off and not pull their weight. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers and product knowledge. The company was always having contest and competitions among employees which did not help with low moral issues. ", ' During a typical work day there are many, many opportunities to get to know fellow Associates, follow up on leads and Operations discrepancies, and seek out patrons wishing to take advantage of The Home Depot.  THD is a great place to work and has competitive wages &amp; benefits packages.  The hardest part of the job was trying to keep with all the wants &amp; needs of the position.  Between Safety, Operations, and Theft &amp; Fraud there never seemed to be enough time in the day!  Luckily, a company cell phone and VPN allowed for a flexible schedule leading to greater results and increased work-life balance. ', " Continually expected to work 10 to 12 hours per day, they claim they don't but they schedule you for mandatory meetings that extend your day. Expected to be checking emails and give your personal cell for contact on your time off. Very low salary/pay, benefits ok, but the bonuses are no where near what they promise.  No one I met has ever received the promised 25% even if they exceed sales plan. They don't fire people often so job security is pretty good but then you have to work with below par employees that should have been fired in their probationary period. Everyone is tired.  There is no work/life balance and this impacts the culture. It is a retail environment so most people are upbeat and ready to give good customer service which can look deceiving.  Look deeper and you will see the reality. ", ' Nice starting job if your straight out of High School and need to acquire some work experience. They offer a variety of skill sets from cashiers to sales and warehouse duties. You will also learn and gain experience in the culture of large, "Coporate America", where they love young, inexperienced but motivated people to munipulate and promote their business model and agenda. As for a working adult, they neither pay enough to support a family or give enough hours to take part in the great benefits that they offer. But, if your 18 and out of school, and can afford to invest in several years of doing the deeds that move you up the ladder, you can may be get to some type of management position, where you will then receive a decent wage. ', " Other than the rotating door called management which never consists of the same cast you can learn a great deal and move up the internal hierarchy. They treat the lot associates poorly and overwork them, and hours can suck as most retail. However what sets them apart is the base salary which is higher than most, their flexibility with your life, sick and vacation time, as well as a wide variety of events and benefits. The biggest thing is they trust me to do my work and don't baby me or constantly check in on you. Great entry level job...just don't make a career out of it.

The hardest part of the job is the physical to that the work puts on your body over time with the heavy lifting and the constant different tasked asked of you. My management were like family, really approachable and they made you want to work hard for them. ', ' I have loved my time with this company and do find that it is very enjoyable to work in most stores. I do find the pay to be a little low especially for those that take their own time to learn new skills and receive extra training to not receive a pay raise.  I will warn you that if you are part time (I am not) that hours for the most part are very limited through most of the year with the exception of holidays (off seasons you can get as low as 6 hours for the week to 18 hours). You also will not receive benefits if you are only part time.  The good thing is that they do work with school and child care situations as long as you have the paper work to back up your needs.

They have ongoing knowledge about so many household and daily life situations. I've been very fortunate to learn so much while I was there. The work team and management was extremely helpful and they were always willing to help with me if I didn't understand something.

But my favorite part about the job was always being able to find someone who would help you find an answer or solution to a question you are being asked. ", ' Even as a normal departmental associate, there is always something to be doing. Maintaining stock and pursuing answers for customers are most of the day but there are also many smaller tasks plainly laid out each morning. Within a year, I had moved up to being a full-time associate and soon after to being a specialist, all by merely doing my best every day (and making sure management knew it). The benefits for a full-time associate are comprehensive and clearly described, including 401K matching. Management is often seen wandering the sales floor and they wear the same aprons are the normal associates, meaning they end up helping customers just like the rest. ', " Typical day at work involved standing long periods of time on concrete floor, management tended to hire very immature young employees who didn't want to work and had negative attitudes, and were rude to customers and co workers.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with insubordinate co workers who liked to goof off and not pull their weight. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers and product knowledge. The company was always having contest and competitions among employees which did not help with low moral issues. ", ' During a typical work day there are many, many opportunities to get to know fellow Associates, follow up on leads and Operations discrepancies, and seek out patrons wishing to take advantage of The Home Depot.  THD is a great place to work and has competitive wages &amp; benefits packages.  The hardest part of the job was trying to keep with all the wants &amp; needs of the position.  Between Safety, Operations, and Theft &amp; Fraud there never seemed to be enough time in the day!  Luckily, a company cell phone and VPN allowed for a flexible schedule leading to greater results and increased work-life balance. ', ' Home Depot prides themselves on teamwork and communication. The main focus is always on keeping customers and staff happy. Great community to be apart of, and admirable devotion to being involved in their residential communities. Regular donations to Habit for Humanity and The Orange Door Project for youth homeless. Associates are encouraged and expected to strive to learn more and take charge. Customer satisfaction is guaranteed number one. ', " Other than the rotating door called management which never consists of the same cast you can learn a great deal and move up the internal hierarchy. They treat the lot associates poorly and overwork them, and hours can suck as most retail. However what sets them apart is the base salary which is higher than most, their flexibility with your life, sick and vacation time, as well as a wide variety of events and benefits. The biggest thing is they trust me to do my work and don't baby me or constantly check in on you. Great entry level job...just don't make a career out of it. ", " Iso loved working at the RDC. I loved how the coaches acted like friends to me. I'm always nervous at new places and everyone took me in.

The only hard part I found about this job picking up 5 gallon paint and unloading charcoal and broken pallets. That is it. The pay is so great, and the benefits are so wonderful.  All in all I would recommend this job to become a career for anyone ", ' I have loved my time with this company and do find that it is very enjoyable to work in most stores. I do find the pay to be a little low especially for those that take their own time to learn new skills and receive extra training to not receive a pay raise.  I will warn you that if you are part time (I am not) that hours for the most part are very limited through most of the year with the exception of holidays (off seasons you can get as low as 6 hours for the week to 18 hours). You also will not receive benefits if you are only part time.  The good thing is that they do work with school and child care situations as long as you have the paper work to back up your needs. ', ' Nice starting job if your straight out of High School and need to acquire some work experience. They offer a variety of skill sets from cashiers to sales and warehouse duties. You will also learn and gain experience in the culture of large, "Coporate America", where they love young, inexperienced but motivated people to munipulate and promote their business model and agenda. As for a working adult, they neither pay enough to support a family or give enough hours to take part in the great benefits that they offer. But, if your 18 and out of school, and can afford to invest in several years of doing the deeds that move you up the ladder, you can may be get to some type of management position, where you will then receive a decent wage. ', " I love working at the Home Depot RDC because there are a lot of opportunities to expand your skills and move up in the company.  It is always busy from day to day(except during the holidays where it tends to be slow). Probably the biggest thing you may have to overcome is the co-workers and their lack of attention to detail of the job requirements.  Outside of that, you get great benefits plus profit sharing bonuses every quarter and raises every year.  All you really need to do is do your job the way they require you to and show some ambition and you'll move ahead there. ", ' Environment was stimulating until poor quality began to seep into the management structure.  Compensation could have been improved also.  Compensation was not commensurate with worked performed and responsibilities assumed.  Felt highly esteemed by co-workers and customers alike, yet received just the opposite response from management.  Communication was way only and did not go uphill.  No feedback on submission of ideas to improve the company.  Praise rarely given.  Difficulty encountered in getting reimbursed for expenses. ', " overall HD is a good company but I can only Speak on my experience with my own store. When I first started there It was very hopeful and i was looking to grow, that idea quickly turned into a headache as I felt my management didn't have a a good grasp on how to maintain morale among staff (little to no recognition for achievements, constant negative critique), they practiced in favoritism (awards and promotions stayed within a particular circle) and it was very apparent to many of the staff. after awhile progression felt non existent no matter how much was put into the work. many times it felt as if our store didn't practice the Core Values that Home Depot preaches, but as I said my experience my particular store.

As a supervisor you are expected to give your life to that place. It is a solid company to work for but typical Politics of most job settings unfortunately handwork doesn't speak for itself and that was frustrating. The benefits and 401k are great. The pay can be really good if you move through the system the right way such as certain departments and positions. If you stay in the same position raises generally aren't that great. Bonuses can be good if your store performs well and success sharing.  If you are offered the opportunity to get training in ATL that was the best part of my time with the company, great and beneficial experience. As with any job there are pros and cons. ", " Iso loved working at the RDC. I loved how the coaches acted like friends to me. I'm always nervous at new places and everyone took me in. As long as you have the need for learning and love to work hard and not afraid of manual labor, this job is the greatest. The only hard part I found about this job picking up 5 gallon paint and unloading charcoal and broken pallets. That is it. The pay is so great, and the benefits are so wonderful.  All in all I would recommend this job to become a career for anyone ", " Home Depot culture is not what it protrays, I think they have to many bosses and not enough workers.  The employees work hard but are not appreciated.  Employees work only part time with no benefits which how Home Depot doesn't  have to pay medical benefit.  The employees that I worked with were dedicated to Home Depot but were not appreciated like they should of been.    I was with Home Depot a short time and I did enjoy my job but management as a whole needed to be revamp from the top down and get back to basic and learn to really see how there employees work hard for Home Depot. ", " I loved working for the Home Depot,. It was a very hard working and exciting working environment. I met so many nice people and learned so many great tools that I could use in life. They have ongoing knowledge about so many household and daily life situations. I've been very fortunate to learn so much while I was there. The work team and management was extremely helpful and they were always willing to help with me if I didn't understand something. The Hardest part of the job would probably be taking on a question you are not familiar with. But my favorite part about the job was always being able to find someone who would help you find an answer or solution to a question you are being asked. ", ' Home Depot prides themselves on teamwork and communication. The main focus is always on keeping customers and staff happy. Great community to be apart of, and admirable devotion to being involved in their residential communities. Regular donations to Habit for Humanity and The Orange Door Project for youth homeless. Associates are encouraged and expected to strive to learn more and take charge. Customer satisfaction is guaranteed number one. ', ' Even as a normal departmental associate, there is always something to be doing. Maintaining stock and pursuing answers for customers are most of the day but there are also many smaller tasks plainly laid out each morning. Within a year, I had moved up to being a full-time associate and soon after to being a specialist, all by merely doing my best every day (and making sure management knew it). The benefits for a full-time associate are comprehensive and clearly described, including 401K matching. Management is often seen wandering the sales floor and they wear the same aprons are the normal associates, meaning they end up helping customers just like the rest. ', " Typical day at work involved standing long periods of time on concrete floor, management tended to hire very immature young employees who didn't want to work and had negative attitudes, and were rude to customers and co workers.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with insubordinate co workers who liked to goof off and not pull their weight. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers and product knowledge. The company was always having contest and competitions among employees which did not help with low moral issues. ", ' During a typical work day there are many, many opportunities to get to know fellow Associates, follow up on leads and Operations discrepancies, and seek out patrons wishing to take advantage of The Home Depot.  THD is a great place to work and has competitive wages &amp; benefits packages.  The hardest part of the job was trying to keep with all the wants &amp; needs of the position.  Between Safety, Operations, and Theft &amp; Fraud there never seemed to be enough time in the day!  Luckily, a company cell phone and VPN allowed for a flexible schedule leading to greater results and increased work-life balance. ', " Continually expected to work 10 to 12 hours per day, they claim they don't but they schedule you for mandatory meetings that extend your day. Expected to be checking emails and give your personal cell for contact on your time off. Very low salary/pay, benefits ok, but the bonuses are no where near what they promise.  No one I met has ever received the promised 25% even if they exceed sales plan. They don't fire people often so job security is pretty good but then you have to work with below par employees that should have been fired in their probationary period. Everyone is tired.  There is no work/life balance and this impacts the culture. It is a retail environment so most people are upbeat and ready to give good customer service which can look deceiving.  Look deeper and you will see the reality. ", ' Nice starting job if your straight out of High School and need to acquire some work experience. They offer a variety of skill sets from cashiers to sales and warehouse duties. You will also learn and gain experience in the culture of large, "Coporate America", where they love young, inexperienced but motivated people to munipulate and promote their business model and agenda. As for a working adult, they neither pay enough to support a family or give enough hours to take part in the great benefits that they offer. But, if your 18 and out of school, and can afford to invest in several years of doing the deeds that move you up the ladder, you can may be get to some type of management position, where you will then receive a decent wage. ', " Other than the rotating door called management which never consists of the same cast you can learn a great deal and move up the internal hierarchy. They treat the lot associates poorly and overwork them, and hours can suck as most retail. However what sets them apart is the base salary which is higher than most, their flexibility with your life, sick and vacation time, as well as a wide variety of events and benefits. The biggest thing is they trust me to do my work and don't baby me or constantly check in on you. Great entry level job...just don't make a career out of it. ", ' The Home Depot gives you a feeling of family each and everyday. You work and you learn new and exciting things that has personally help me with my growth as a person and worker. The hardest part of the job is the physical to that the work puts on your body over time with the heavy lifting and the constant different tasked asked of you. My management were like family, really approachable and they made you want to work hard for them. ', ' I have loved my time with this company and do find that it is very enjoyable to work in most stores. I do find the pay to be a little low especially for those that take their own time to learn new skills and receive extra training to not receive a pay raise.  I will warn you that if you are part time (I am not) that hours for the most part are very limited through most of the year with the exception of holidays (off seasons you can get as low as 6 hours for the week to 18 hours). You also will not receive benefits if you are only part time.  The good thing is that they do work with school and child care situations as long as you have the paper work to back up your needs.

In that time I have experienced just about everything one can experience in a retail environment from good to bad.  That being said, Home Depot does indeed care about their associates and customers.  Even though at times their management (store level) are inadequate to this attitude; as a whole there is a great and often successful push to care for their associates and go out of their way for their customers. ', " It's a great company to work for with great benefits and values, but every store is ran different depending on type management. schedule isn't consistent and you work every weekend unless you request off. over all if you work in a store with decent management you will enjoy working for the company. You obtain a lot of useful information on products and on how to do DIY projects. ", " I worked at the Brenham, TX. location and the job advancement opportunities were menial at best.  There is a network there that is impenetrable.  Training was horrible. They sit you in a room with no human interaction. It's strictly computer based for one week.  Then when your released to the floor the expectation is that you know what you're doing and should do as they say and not as they do.  There is constant contradiction between corporate policy and store policy.  Don't fall on the wrong side of the haves and have-nots, you are quickly relinquished of your services.

All in all I would recommend this job to become a career for anyone ", " Home Depot culture is not what it protrays, I think they have to many bosses and not enough workers.  The employees work hard but are not appreciated.  Employees work only part time with no benefits which how Home Depot doesn't  have to pay medical benefit.  The employees that I worked with were dedicated to Home Depot but were not appreciated like they should of been.    I was with Home Depot a short time and I did enjoy my job but management as a whole needed to be revamp from the top down and get back to basic and learn to really see how there employees work hard for Home Depot. ", " I loved working for the Home Depot,. It was a very hard working and exciting working environment. I met so many nice people and learned so many great tools that I could use in life. They have ongoing knowledge about so many household and daily life situations. I've been very fortunate to learn so much while I was there. The work team and management was extremely helpful and they were always willing to help with me if I didn't understand something. The Hardest part of the job would probably be taking on a question you are not familiar with. But my favorite part about the job was always being able to find someone who would help you find an answer or solution to a question you are being asked. ", ' Home Depot prides themselves on teamwork and communication. The main focus is always on keeping customers and staff happy. Great community to be apart of, and admirable devotion to being involved in their residential communities. Regular donations to Habit for Humanity and The Orange Door Project for youth homeless. Associates are encouraged and expected to strive to learn more and take charge. Customer satisfaction is guaranteed number one. ', ' Even as a normal departmental associate, there is always something to be doing. Maintaining stock and pursuing answers for customers are most of the day but there are also many smaller tasks plainly laid out each morning. Within a year, I had moved up to being a full-time associate and soon after to being a specialist, all by merely doing my best every day (and making sure management knew it). The benefits for a full-time associate are comprehensive and clearly described, including 401K matching. Management is often seen wandering the sales floor and they wear the same aprons are the normal associates, meaning they end up helping customers just like the rest. ', " Typical day at work involved standing long periods of time on concrete floor, management tended to hire very immature young employees who didn't want to work and had negative attitudes, and were rude to customers and co workers.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with insubordinate co workers who liked to goof off and not pull their weight. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers and product knowledge. The company was always having contest and competitions among employees which did not help with low moral issues. ", ' During a typical work day there are many, many opportunities to get to know fellow Associates, follow up on leads and Operations discrepancies, and seek out patrons wishing to take advantage of The Home Depot.  THD is a great place to work and has competitive wages &amp; benefits packages.  The hardest part of the job was trying to keep with all the wants &amp; needs of the position.  Between Safety, Operations, and Theft &amp; Fraud there never seemed to be enough time in the day!  Luckily, a company cell phone and VPN allowed for a flexible schedule leading to greater results and increased work-life balance. ', " Continually expected to work 10 to 12 hours per day, they claim they don't but they schedule you for mandatory meetings that extend your day. Expected to be checking emails and give your personal cell for contact on your time off. Very low salary/pay, benefits ok, but the bonuses are no where near what they promise.  No one I met has ever received the promised 25% even if they exceed sales plan. They don't fire people often so job security is pretty good but then you have to work with below par employees that should have been fired in their probationary period. Everyone is tired.  There is no work/life balance and this impacts the culture. It is a retail environment so most people are upbeat and ready to give good customer service which can look deceiving.  Look deeper and you will see the reality. ", ' Nice starting job if your straight out of High School and need to acquire some work experience. They offer a variety of skill sets from cashiers to sales and warehouse duties. You will also learn and gain experience in the culture of large, "Coporate America", where they love young, inexperienced but motivated people to munipulate and promote their business model and agenda. As for a working adult, they neither pay enough to support a family or give enough hours to take part in the great benefits that they offer. But, if your 18 and out of school, and can afford to invest in several years of doing the deeds that move you up the ladder, you can may be get to some type of management position, where you will then receive a decent wage. ', " Other than the rotating door called management which never consists of the same cast you can learn a great deal and move up the internal hierarchy. They treat the lot associates poorly and overwork them, and hours can suck as most retail. However what sets them apart is the base salary which is higher than most, their flexibility with your life, sick and vacation time, as well as a wide variety of events and benefits. The biggest thing is they trust me to do my work and don't baby me or constantly check in on you. Great entry level job...just don't make a career out of it.

My management were like family, really approachable and they made you want to work hard for them. ', ' I have loved my time with this company and do find that it is very enjoyable to work in most stores. I do find the pay to be a little low especially for those that take their own time to learn new skills and receive extra training to not receive a pay raise.  I will warn you that if you are part time (I am not) that hours for the most part are very limited through most of the year with the exception of holidays (off seasons you can get as low as 6 hours for the week to 18 hours). You also will not receive benefits if you are only part time.  The good thing is that they do work with school and child care situations as long as you have the paper work to back up your needs.

In that time I have experienced just about everything one can experience in a retail environment from good to bad.  That being said, Home Depot does indeed care about their associates and customers.  Even though at times their management (store level) are inadequate to this attitude; as a whole there is a great and often successful push to care for their associates and go out of their way for their customers. ', " It's a great company to work for with great benefits and values, but every store is ran different depending on type management. schedule isn't consistent and you work every weekend unless you request off. over all if you work in a store with decent management you will enjoy working for the company. You obtain a lot of useful information on products and on how to do DIY projects. ", " I worked at the Brenham, TX. location and the job advancement opportunities were menial at best.  There is a network there that is impenetrable.  Training was horrible. They sit you in a room with no human interaction. It's strictly computer based for one week.  Then when your released to the floor the expectation is that you know what you're doing and should do as they say and not as they do.  There is constant contradiction between corporate policy and store policy.  Don't fall on the wrong side of the haves and have-nots, you are quickly relinquished of your services. ", " Home Depot culture is not what it protrays, I think they have to many bosses and not enough workers.  The employees work hard but are not appreciated.  Employees work only part time with no benefits which how Home Depot doesn't  have to pay medical benefit.  The employees that I worked with were dedicated to Home Depot but were not appreciated like they should of been.    I was with Home Depot a short time and I did enjoy my job but management as a whole needed to be revamp from the top down and get back to basic and learn to really see how there employees work hard for Home Depot. ", ' I enjoy the people that I work with but the company as a whole could use some help assisting their associates. A typical day at Home Depot would consist of helping customers, cash deposits to the back office at the end of the night. I am one of the part time head cashiers so I over see multiple cashiers and handle cash, checks and credit card information on a daily basis. I have learned how to put customers first and always be willing to lend a helping hand. The hardest part of my job would be management because they are more about the safety of customers than they are their own employees. The most enjoyable part of the company is the people that I work with and customers. ', " loved working for the Home Depot,. It was a very hard working and exciting working environment. I met so many nice people and learned so many great tools that I could use in life. They have ongoing knowledge about so many household and daily life situations. I've been very fortunate to learn so much while I was there. The work team and management was extremely helpful and they were always willing to help with me if I didn't understand something. The Hardest part of the job would probably be taking on a question you are not familiar with. But my favorite part about the job was always being able to find someone who would help you find an answer or solution to a question you are being asked. ", " I am currently working here part time by choice. The pay is still low,  but excellent when compared with competitors.  I really like the atmosphere and the fact that my hours never change.  As with any job,  there are areas for improvement,  but overall I like working here.  I also worked directly with the Home Depot wile  at G.E...and I can say they are a lot better than most places I've worked. ", ' Long days always trying to figure out best purchase for customers needs and budget, always learning about new products and how they work.  dealing with customers that do no know what they what, but want  you to find the right product for "What they are describing" but can bot find anywhere; but on the flipside when you solve a customers problem by finding just what they are looking for..is a great feeling!! ', ' It was a good place to work. Management was always helpful and willing to help whenever possible. Whether it was customers or their associates. Although, the location I was employed at had a bit of a gossiping problem. Very high-school and unprofessional among some of the employees. Other than that, I enjoyed working there for the most part. I like that they strive to always put the customer first and make sure the customers needs are continuously met. ', " Management is content to be kept in the dark regarding employee complaints, but let a couple of people make calls to the company because they didn't like something and you get fired. Management doesn't stand behind the employees unless you are one of the brown-nosers in their hind pocket, then it doesn't matter what you do.  Most of the people are fun to work with, it's too bad the company policies aren't upheld as they are supposed to be. It often makes for a hostile work environment. ", " If your a good worker they will pile more and more jobs on you to make up for the lazy people because they're too afraid to manage lazy people because the lazy people will tell corporate on them for making them do their job. Stay away from this corporation all together even buying products from them they don't stand by their product they just tell you to call corporate and they give you the run around until you give up. Smokers are allowed to take 6 smoke breaks in an 8 hr shift because some management are smokers. Took 2 months to get hired in don't bother applying. ", " I work at Home Depot for 9 months.About half as a lot associate half as a Bopis. The work was part-time which is why i left. The company was pretty nice to work for. I also left do to the heavy lifting of my job because part time associates don't have full health benefits. Co workers made the place great as the they always helped when i needed it and i would help them a lot too. ", ' Opportunity for advancement, wages are not too fair with the amount of work enforced by employees. Management can be very tough but loving. The best thing about being an employee for Home Depot is all the benefits they offer throughout the year (bonuses, bonus parties, Christmas party, pot sharing, and barbecues etc). The hardest part about working for Home Depot is working extremely hard for not enough pay (for the amount of work that is done). '][' This company was my first love that I started to work with.

I do find the pay to be a little low especially for those that take their own time to learn new skills and receive extra training to not receive a pay raise.  I will warn you that if you are part time (I am not) that hours for the most part are very limited through most of the year with the exception of holidays (off seasons you can get as low as 6 hours for the week to 18 hours). You also will not receive benefits if you are only part time.  The good thing is that they do work with school and child care situations as long as you have the paper work to back up your needs.

You will also learn and gain experience in the culture of large, "Coporate America", where they love young, inexperienced but motivated people to munipulate and promote their business model and agenda. As for a working adult, they neither pay enough to support a family or give enough hours to take part in the great benefits that they offer. But, if your 18 and out of school, and can afford to invest in several years of doing the deeds that move you up the ladder, you can may be get to some type of management position, where you will then receive a decent wage. ', " I love working at the Home Depot RDC because there are a lot of opportunities to expand your skills and move up in the company.  It is always busy from day to day(except during the holidays where it tends to be slow). Probably the biggest thing you may have to overcome is the co-workers and their lack of attention to detail of the job requirements.  Outside of that, you get great benefits plus profit sharing bonuses every quarter and raises every year.  All you really need to do is do your job the way they require you to and show some ambition and you'll move ahead there.

As a supervisor you are expected to give your life to that place. It is a solid company to work for but typical Politics of most job settings unfortunately handwork doesn't speak for itself and that was frustrating. The benefits and 401k are great. The pay can be really good if you move through the system the right way such as certain departments and positions. If you stay in the same position raises generally aren't that great. Bonuses can be good if your store performs well and success sharing.

They have ongoing knowledge about so many household and daily life situations. I've been very fortunate to learn so much while I was there. The work team and management was extremely helpful and they were always willing to help with me if I didn't understand something. The Hardest part of the job would probably be taking on a question you are not familiar with. But my favorite part about the job was always being able to find someone who would help you find an answer or solution to a question you are being asked. ", ' Even as a normal departmental associate, there is always something to be doing. Maintaining stock and pursuing answers for customers are most of the day but there are also many smaller tasks plainly laid out each morning. Within a year, I had moved up to being a full-time associate and soon after to being a specialist, all by merely doing my best every day (and making sure management knew it). The benefits for a full-time associate are comprehensive and clearly described, including 401K matching. Management is often seen wandering the sales floor and they wear the same aprons are the normal associates, meaning they end up helping customers just like the rest. ', " Typical day at work involved standing long periods of time on concrete floor, management tended to hire very immature young employees who didn't want to work and had negative attitudes, and were rude to customers and co workers.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with insubordinate co workers who liked to goof off and not pull their weight. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers and product knowledge. The company was always having contest and competitions among employees which did not help with low moral issues.

', " Other than the rotating door called management which never consists of the same cast you can learn a great deal and move up the internal hierarchy. They treat the lot associates poorly and overwork them, and hours can suck as most retail. However what sets them apart is the base salary which is higher than most, their flexibility with your life, sick and vacation time, as well as a wide variety of events and benefits. The biggest thing is they trust me to do my work and don't baby me or constantly check in on you. Great entry level job...just don't make a career out of it. ", " Iso loved working at the RDC. I loved how the coaches acted like friends to me. I'm always nervous at new places and everyone took me in. As long as you have the need for learning and love to work hard and not afraid of manual labor, this job is the greatest. The only hard part I found about this job picking up 5 gallon paint and unloading charcoal and broken pallets. That is it. The pay is so great, and the benefits are so wonderful.  All in all I would recommend this job to become a career for anyone ", ' I have loved my time with this company and do find that it is very enjoyable to work in most stores. I do find the pay to be a little low especially for those that take their own time to learn new skills and receive extra training to not receive a pay raise.  I will warn you that if you are part time (I am not) that hours for the most part are very limited through most of the year with the exception of holidays (off seasons you can get as low as 6 hours for the week to 18 hours). You also will not receive benefits if you are only part time.  The good thing is that they do work with school and child care situations as long as you have the paper work to back up your needs. ', ' Nice starting job if your straight out of High School and need to acquire some work experience. They offer a variety of skill sets from cashiers to sales and warehouse duties. You will also learn and gain experience in the culture of large, "Coporate America", where they love young, inexperienced but motivated people to munipulate and promote their business model and agenda. As for a working adult, they neither pay enough to support a family or give enough hours to take part in the great benefits that they offer. But, if your 18 and out of school, and can afford to invest in several years of doing the deeds that move you up the ladder, you can may be get to some type of management position, where you will then receive a decent wage. ', " I love working at the Home Depot RDC because there are a lot of opportunities to expand your skills and move up in the company.  It is always busy from day to day(except during the holidays where it tends to be slow). Probably the biggest thing you may have to overcome is the co-workers and their lack of attention to detail of the job requirements.  Outside of that, you get great benefits plus profit sharing bonuses every quarter and raises every year.  All you really need to do is do your job the way they require you to and show some ambition and you'll move ahead there. ", ' Environment was stimulating until poor quality began to seep into the management structure.  Compensation could have been improved also.  Compensation was not commensurate with worked performed and responsibilities assumed.

When I first started there It was very hopeful and i was looking to grow, that idea quickly turned into a headache as I felt my management didn't have a a good grasp on how to maintain morale among staff (little to no recognition for achievements, constant negative critique), they practiced in favoritism (awards and promotions stayed within a particular circle) and it was very apparent to many of the staff. after awhile progression felt non existent no matter how much was put into the work. many times it felt as if our store didn't practice the Core Values that Home Depot preaches, but as I said my experience my particular store.

You will also learn and gain experience in the culture of large, "Coporate America", where they love young, inexperienced but motivated people to munipulate and promote their business model and agenda. As for a working adult, they neither pay enough to support a family or give enough hours to take part in the great benefits that they offer.

It is always busy from day to day(except during the holidays where it tends to be slow). Probably the biggest thing you may have to overcome is the co-workers and their lack of attention to detail of the job requirements.  Outside of that, you get great benefits plus profit sharing bonuses every quarter and raises every year.  All you really need to do is do your job the way they require you to and show some ambition and you'll move ahead there.

It is a solid company to work for but typical Politics of most job settings unfortunately handwork doesn't speak for itself and that was frustrating. The benefits and 401k are great. The pay can be really good if you move through the system the right way such as certain departments and positions. If you stay in the same position raises generally aren't that great.

All in all I would recommend this job to become a career for anyone ", " Home Depot culture is not what it protrays, I think they have to many bosses and not enough workers.  The employees work hard but are not appreciated.  Employees work only part time with no benefits which how Home Depot doesn't  have to pay medical benefit.  The employees that I worked with were dedicated to Home Depot but were not appreciated like they should of been.    I was with Home Depot a short time and I did enjoy my job but management as a whole needed to be revamp from the top down and get back to basic and learn to really see how there employees work hard for Home Depot. ", " I loved working for the Home Depot,. It was a very hard working and exciting working environment. I met so many nice people and learned so many great tools that I could use in life. They have ongoing knowledge about so many household and daily life situations. I've been very fortunate to learn so much while I was there. The work team and management was extremely helpful and they were always willing to help with me if I didn't understand something. The Hardest part of the job would probably be taking on a question you are not familiar with. But my favorite part about the job was always being able to find someone who would help you find an answer or solution to a question you are being asked. ", ' Home Depot prides themselves on teamwork and communication. The main focus is always on keeping customers and staff happy. Great community to be apart of, and admirable devotion to being involved in their residential communities. Regular donations to Habit for Humanity and The Orange Door Project for youth homeless. Associates are encouraged and expected to strive to learn more and take charge. Customer satisfaction is guaranteed number one. ', ' Even as a normal departmental associate, there is always something to be doing. Maintaining stock and pursuing answers for customers are most of the day but there are also many smaller tasks plainly laid out each morning. Within a year, I had moved up to being a full-time associate and soon after to being a specialist, all by merely doing my best every day (and making sure management knew it). The benefits for a full-time associate are comprehensive and clearly described, including 401K matching. Management is often seen wandering the sales floor and they wear the same aprons are the normal associates, meaning they end up helping customers just like the rest. ', " Typical day at work involved standing long periods of time on concrete floor, management tended to hire very immature young employees who didn't want to work and had negative attitudes, and were rude to customers and co workers.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with insubordinate co workers who liked to goof off and not pull their weight. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers and product knowledge. The company was always having contest and competitions among employees which did not help with low moral issues. ", ' During a typical work day there are many, many opportunities to get to know fellow Associates, follow up on leads and Operations discrepancies, and seek out patrons wishing to take advantage of The Home Depot.  THD is a great place to work and has competitive wages &amp; benefits packages.  The hardest part of the job was trying to keep with all the wants &amp; needs of the position.  Between Safety, Operations, and Theft &amp; Fraud there never seemed to be enough time in the day!  Luckily, a company cell phone and VPN allowed for a flexible schedule leading to greater results and increased work-life balance. ', " Continually expected to work 10 to 12 hours per day, they claim they don't but they schedule you for mandatory meetings that extend your day. Expected to be checking emails and give your personal cell for contact on your time off. Very low salary/pay, benefits ok, but the bonuses are no where near what they promise.  No one I met has ever received the promised 25% even if they exceed sales plan. They don't fire people often so job security is pretty good but then you have to work with below par employees that should have been fired in their probationary period. Everyone is tired.  There is no work/life balance and this impacts the culture. It is a retail environment so most people are upbeat and ready to give good customer service which can look deceiving.  Look deeper and you will see the reality. ", ' Nice starting job if your straight out of High School and need to acquire some work experience. They offer a variety of skill sets from cashiers to sales and warehouse duties. You will also learn and gain experience in the culture of large, "Coporate America", where they love young, inexperienced but motivated people to munipulate and promote their business model and agenda. As for a working adult, they neither pay enough to support a family or give enough hours to take part in the great benefits that they offer. But, if your 18 and out of school, and can afford to invest in several years of doing the deeds that move you up the ladder, you can may be get to some type of management position, where you will then receive a decent wage. ', " Other than the rotating door called management which never consists of the same cast you can learn a great deal and move up the internal hierarchy. They treat the lot associates poorly and overwork them, and hours can suck as most retail. However what sets them apart is the base salary which is higher than most, their flexibility with your life, sick and vacation time, as well as a wide variety of events and benefits. The biggest thing is they trust me to do my work and don't baby me or constantly check in on you. Great entry level job...just don't make a career out of it.

My management were like family, really approachable and they made you want to work hard for them. ', ' I have loved my time with this company and do find that it is very enjoyable to work in most stores. I do find the pay to be a little low especially for those that take their own time to learn new skills and receive extra training to not receive a pay raise.  I will warn you that if you are part time (I am not) that hours for the most part are very limited through most of the year with the exception of holidays (off seasons you can get as low as 6 hours for the week to 18 hours). You also will not receive benefits if you are only part time.  The good thing is that they do work with school and child care situations as long as you have the paper work to back up your needs.

Even though at times their management (store level) are inadequate to this attitude; as a whole there is a great and often successful push to care for their associates and go out of their way for their customers. ', " It's a great company to work for with great benefits and values, but every store is ran different depending on type management. schedule isn't consistent and you work every weekend unless you request off. over all if you work in a store with decent management you will enjoy working for the company. You obtain a lot of useful information on products and on how to do DIY projects. ", " I worked at the Brenham, TX. location and the job advancement opportunities were menial at best.  There is a network there that is impenetrable.  Training was horrible. They sit you in a room with no human interaction. It's strictly computer based for one week.  Then when your released to the floor the expectation is that you know what you're doing and should do as they say and not as they do.  There is constant contradiction between corporate policy and store policy.  Don't fall on the wrong side of the haves and have-nots, you are quickly relinquished of your services. ", " Home Depot culture is not what it protrays, I think they have to many bosses and not enough workers.  The employees work hard but are not appreciated.  Employees work only part time with no benefits which how Home Depot doesn't  have to pay medical benefit.  The employees that I worked with were dedicated to Home Depot but were not appreciated like they should of been.    I was with Home Depot a short time and I did enjoy my job but management as a whole needed to be revamp from the top down and get back to basic and learn to really see how there employees work hard for Home Depot. ", ' I enjoy the people that I work with but the company as a whole could use some help assisting their associates. A typical day at Home Depot would consist of helping customers, cash deposits to the back office at the end of the night. I am one of the part time head cashiers so I over see multiple cashiers and handle cash, checks and credit card information on a daily basis. I have learned how to put customers first and always be willing to lend a helping hand. The hardest part of my job would be management because they are more about the safety of customers than they are their own employees. The most enjoyable part of the company is the people that I work with and customers. ', " loved working for the Home Depot,. It was a very hard working and exciting working environment. I met so many nice people and learned so many great tools that I could use in life. They have ongoing knowledge about so many household and daily life situations. I've been very fortunate to learn so much while I was there. The work team and management was extremely helpful and they were always willing to help with me if I didn't understand something. The Hardest part of the job would probably be taking on a question you are not familiar with. But my favorite part about the job was always being able to find someone who would help you find an answer or solution to a question you are being asked. ", " I am currently working here part time by choice. The pay is still low,  but excellent when compared with competitors.  I really like the atmosphere and the fact that my hours never change.

I also worked directly with the Home Depot wile  at G.E...and I can say they are a lot better than most places I've worked. ", ' Long days always trying to figure out best purchase for customers needs and budget, always learning about new products and how they work.  dealing with customers that do no know what they what, but want  you to find the right product for "What they are describing" but can bot find anywhere; but on the flipside when you solve a customers problem by finding just what they are looking for..is a great feeling!! ', ' It was a good place to work. Management was always helpful and willing to help whenever possible. Whether it was customers or their associates. Although, the location I was employed at had a bit of a gossiping problem. Very high-school and unprofessional among some of the employees. Other than that, I enjoyed working there for the most part. I like that they strive to always put the customer first and make sure the customers needs are continuously met. ', " Management is content to be kept in the dark regarding employee complaints, but let a couple of people make calls to the company because they didn't like something and you get fired. Management doesn't stand behind the employees unless you are one of the brown-nosers in their hind pocket, then it doesn't matter what you do.  Most of the people are fun to work with, it's too bad the company policies aren't upheld as they are supposed to be. It often makes for a hostile work environment. ", " If your a good worker they will pile more and more jobs on you to make up for the lazy people because they're too afraid to manage lazy people because the lazy people will tell corporate on them for making them do their job. Stay away from this corporation all together even buying products from them they don't stand by their product they just tell you to call corporate and they give you the run around until you give up. Smokers are allowed to take 6 smoke breaks in an 8 hr shift because some management are smokers. Took 2 months to get hired in don't bother applying.

The best thing about being an employee for Home Depot is all the benefits they offer throughout the year (bonuses, bonus parties, Christmas party, pot sharing, and barbecues etc).

In that time I have experienced just about everything one can experience in a retail environment from good to bad.  That being said, Home Depot does indeed care about their associates and customers.  Even though at times their management (store level) are inadequate to this attitude; as a whole there is a great and often successful push to care for their associates and go out of their way for their customers. ', " It's a great company to work for with great benefits and values, but every store is ran different depending on type management. schedule isn't consistent and you work every weekend unless you request off. over all if you work in a store with decent management you will enjoy working for the company.

There is a network there that is impenetrable.  Training was horrible. They sit you in a room with no human interaction. It's strictly computer based for one week.  Then when your released to the floor the expectation is that you know what you're doing and should do as they say and not as they do.  There is constant contradiction between corporate policy and store policy.  Don't fall on the wrong side of the haves and have-nots, you are quickly relinquished of your services. ", " Home Depot culture is not what it protrays, I think they have to many bosses and not enough workers.  The employees work hard but are not appreciated.  Employees work only part time with no benefits which how Home Depot doesn't  have to pay medical benefit.  The employees that I worked with were dedicated to Home Depot but were not appreciated like they should of been.

A typical day at Home Depot would consist of helping customers, cash deposits to the back office at the end of the night. I am one of the part time head cashiers so I over see multiple cashiers and handle cash, checks and credit card information on a daily basis. I have learned how to put customers first and always be willing to lend a helping hand.

I met so many nice people and learned so many great tools that I could use in life. They have ongoing knowledge about so many household and daily life situations. I've been very fortunate to learn so much while I was there. The work team and management was extremely helpful and they were always willing to help with me if I didn't understand something.

The benefits for a full-time associate are comprehensive and clearly described, including 401K matching. Management is often seen wandering the sales floor and they wear the same aprons are the normal associates, meaning they end up helping customers just like the rest.

No one I met has ever received the promised 25% even if they exceed sales plan. They don't fire people often so job security is pretty good but then you have to work with below par employees that should have been fired in their probationary period. Everyone is tired.

In that time I have experienced just about everything one can experience in a retail environment from good to bad.  That being said, Home Depot does indeed care about their associates and customers.  Even though at times their management (store level) are inadequate to this attitude; as a whole there is a great and often successful push to care for their associates and go out of their way for their customers. ', " It's a great company to work for with great benefits and values, but every store is ran different depending on type management. schedule isn't consistent and you work every weekend unless you request off. over all if you work in a store with decent management you will enjoy working for the company. You obtain a lot of useful information on products and on how to do DIY projects. ", " I worked at the Brenham, TX. location and the job advancement opportunities were menial at best.  There is a network there that is impenetrable.  Training was horrible. They sit you in a room with no human interaction. It's strictly computer based for one week.  Then when your released to the floor the expectation is that you know what you're doing and should do as they say and not as they do.  There is constant contradiction between corporate policy and store policy.  Don't fall on the wrong side of the haves and have-nots, you are quickly relinquished of your services. ", " Home Depot culture is not what it protrays, I think they have to many bosses and not enough workers.  The employees work hard but are not appreciated.  Employees work only part time with no benefits which how Home Depot doesn't  have to pay medical benefit.  The employees that I worked with were dedicated to Home Depot but were not appreciated like they should of been.    I was with Home Depot a short time and I did enjoy my job but management as a whole needed to be revamp from the top down and get back to basic and learn to really see how there employees work hard for Home Depot. ", ' I enjoy the people that I work with but the company as a whole could use some help assisting their associates. A typical day at Home Depot would consist of helping customers, cash deposits to the back office at the end of the night. I am one of the part time head cashiers so I over see multiple cashiers and handle cash, checks and credit card information on a daily basis. I have learned how to put customers first and always be willing to lend a helping hand. The hardest part of my job would be management because they are more about the safety of customers than they are their own employees. The most enjoyable part of the company is the people that I work with and customers. ', " loved working for the Home Depot,. It was a very hard working and exciting working environment. I met so many nice people and learned so many great tools that I could use in life. They have ongoing knowledge about so many household and daily life situations. I've been very fortunate to learn so much while I was there. The work team and management was extremely helpful and they were always willing to help with me if I didn't understand something. The Hardest part of the job would probably be taking on a question you are not familiar with. But my favorite part about the job was always being able to find someone who would help you find an answer or solution to a question you are being asked. ", " I am currently working here part time by choice. The pay is still low,  but excellent when compared with competitors.  I really like the atmosphere and the fact that my hours never change.  As with any job,  there are areas for improvement,  but overall I like working here.  I also worked directly with the Home Depot wile  at G.E...and I can say they are a lot better than most places I've worked. ", ' Long days always trying to figure out best purchase for customers needs and budget, always learning about new products and how they work.  dealing with customers that do no know what they what, but want  you to find the right product for "What they are describing" but can bot find anywhere; but on the flipside when you solve a customers problem by finding just what they are looking for..is a great feeling!! ', ' It was a good place to work. Management was always helpful and willing to help whenever possible. Whether it was customers or their associates. Although, the location I was employed at had a bit of a gossiping problem. Very high-school and unprofessional among some of the employees. Other than that, I enjoyed working there for the most part. I like that they strive to always put the customer first and make sure the customers needs are continuously met. ', " Management is content to be kept in the dark regarding employee complaints, but let a couple of people make calls to the company because they didn't like something and you get fired. Management doesn't stand behind the employees unless you are one of the brown-nosers in their hind pocket, then it doesn't matter what you do.  Most of the people are fun to work with, it's too bad the company policies aren't upheld as they are supposed to be. It often makes for a hostile work environment. ", " If your a good worker they will pile more and more jobs on you to make up for the lazy people because they're too afraid to manage lazy people because the lazy people will tell corporate on them for making them do their job. Stay away from this corporation all together even buying products from them they don't stand by their product they just tell you to call corporate and they give you the run around until you give up. Smokers are allowed to take 6 smoke breaks in an 8 hr shift because some management are smokers. Took 2 months to get hired in don't bother applying. ", " I work at Home Depot for 9 months.About half as a lot associate half as a Bopis. The work was part-time which is why i left. The company was pretty nice to work for. I also left do to the heavy lifting of my job because part time associates don't have full health benefits. Co workers made the place great as the they always helped when i needed it and i would help them a lot too. ", ' Opportunity for advancement, wages are not too fair with the amount of work enforced by employees. Management can be very tough but loving. The best thing about being an employee for Home Depot is all the benefits they offer throughout the year (bonuses, bonus parties, Christmas party, pot sharing, and barbecues etc). The hardest part about working for Home Depot is working extremely hard for not enough pay (for the amount of work that is done). '][' This company was my first love that I started to work with.

As a supervisor you are expected to give your life to that place. It is a solid company to work for but typical Politics of most job settings unfortunately handwork doesn't speak for itself and that was frustrating. The benefits and 401k are great. The pay can be really good if you move through the system the right way such as certain departments and positions. If you stay in the same position raises generally aren't that great. Bonuses can be good if your store performs well and success sharing.  If you are offered the opportunity to get training in ATL that was the best part of my time with the company, great and beneficial experience. As with any job there are pros and cons. ", " I loved working for the Home Depot,. It was a very hard working and exciting working environment. I met so many nice people and learned so many great tools that I could use in life. They have ongoing knowledge about so many household and daily life situations. I've been very fortunate to learn so much while I was there. The work team and management was extremely helpful and they were always willing to help with me if I didn't understand something. The Hardest part of the job would probably be taking on a question you are not familiar with. But my favorite part about the job was always being able to find someone who would help you find an answer or solution to a question you are being asked. ", ' Even as a normal departmental associate, there is always something to be doing. Maintaining stock and pursuing answers for customers are most of the day but there are also many smaller tasks plainly laid out each morning. Within a year, I had moved up to being a full-time associate and soon after to being a specialist, all by merely doing my best every day (and making sure management knew it). The benefits for a full-time associate are comprehensive and clearly described, including 401K matching. Management is often seen wandering the sales floor and they wear the same aprons are the normal associates, meaning they end up helping customers just like the rest. ', " Typical day at work involved standing long periods of time on concrete floor, management tended to hire very immature young employees who didn't want to work and had negative attitudes, and were rude to customers and co workers.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with insubordinate co workers who liked to goof off and not pull their weight. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers and product knowledge. The company was always having contest and competitions among employees which did not help with low moral issues. ", ' During a typical work day there are many, many opportunities to get to know fellow Associates, follow up on leads and Operations discrepancies, and seek out patrons wishing to take advantage of The Home Depot.  THD is a great place to work and has competitive wages &amp; benefits packages.  The hardest part of the job was trying to keep with all the wants &amp; needs of the position.

Luckily, a company cell phone and VPN allowed for a flexible schedule leading to greater results and increased work-life balance. ', ' Home Depot prides themselves on teamwork and communication.

Customer satisfaction is guaranteed number one. ', " Other than the rotating door called management which never consists of the same cast you can learn a great deal and move up the internal hierarchy. They treat the lot associates poorly and overwork them, and hours can suck as most retail. However what sets them apart is the base salary which is higher than most, their flexibility with your life, sick and vacation time, as well as a wide variety of events and benefits. The biggest thing is they trust me to do my work and don't baby me or constantly check in on you. Great entry level job...just don't make a career out of it. ", " Iso loved working at the RDC. I loved how the coaches acted like friends to me. I'm always nervous at new places and everyone took me in. As long as you have the need for learning and love to work hard and not afraid of manual labor, this job is the greatest. The only hard part I found about this job picking up 5 gallon paint and unloading charcoal and broken pallets. That is it. The pay is so great, and the benefits are so wonderful.  All in all I would recommend this job to become a career for anyone ", ' I have loved my time with this company and do find that it is very enjoyable to work in most stores. I do find the pay to be a little low especially for those that take their own time to learn new skills and receive extra training to not receive a pay raise.  I will warn you that if you are part time (I am not) that hours for the most part are very limited through most of the year with the exception of holidays (off seasons you can get as low as 6 hours for the week to 18 hours). You also will not receive benefits if you are only part time.  The good thing is that they do work with school and child care situations as long as you have the paper work to back up your needs. ', ' Nice starting job if your straight out of High School and need to acquire some work experience. They offer a variety of skill sets from cashiers to sales and warehouse duties. You will also learn and gain experience in the culture of large, "Coporate America", where they love young, inexperienced but motivated people to munipulate and promote their business model and agenda. As for a working adult, they neither pay enough to support a family or give enough hours to take part in the great benefits that they offer. But, if your 18 and out of school, and can afford to invest in several years of doing the deeds that move you up the ladder, you can may be get to some type of management position, where you will then receive a decent wage. ', " I love working at the Home Depot RDC because there are a lot of opportunities to expand your skills and move up in the company.  It is always busy from day to day(except during the holidays where it tends to be slow). Probably the biggest thing you may have to overcome is the co-workers and their lack of attention to detail of the job requirements.  Outside of that, you get great benefits plus profit sharing bonuses every quarter and raises every year.  All you really need to do is do your job the way they require you to and show some ambition and you'll move ahead there. ", ' Environment was stimulating until poor quality began to seep into the management structure.  Compensation could have been improved also.  Compensation was not commensurate with worked performed and responsibilities assumed.  Felt highly esteemed by co-workers and customers alike, yet received just the opposite response from management.  Communication was way only and did not go uphill.  No feedback on submission of ideas to improve the company.  Praise rarely given.  Difficulty encountered in getting reimbursed for expenses. ', " overall HD is a good company but I can only Speak on my experience with my own store. When I first started there It was very hopeful and i was looking to grow, that idea quickly turned into a headache as I felt my management didn't have a a good grasp on how to maintain morale among staff (little to no recognition for achievements, constant negative critique), they practiced in favoritism (awards and promotions stayed within a particular circle) and it was very apparent to many of the staff. after awhile progression felt non existent no matter how much was put into the work. many times it felt as if our store didn't practice the Core Values that Home Depot preaches, but as I said my experience my particular store.

In that time I have experienced just about everything one can experience in a retail environment from good to bad.  That being said, Home Depot does indeed care about their associates and customers.

There is constant contradiction between corporate policy and store policy.  Don't fall on the wrong side of the haves and have-nots, you are quickly relinquished of your services.

Although, the location I was employed at had a bit of a gossiping problem. Very high-school and unprofessional among some of the employees. Other than that, I enjoyed working there for the most part. I like that they strive to always put the customer first and make sure the customers needs are continuously met. ', " Management is content to be kept in the dark regarding employee complaints, but let a couple of people make calls to the company because they didn't like something and you get fired. Management doesn't stand behind the employees unless you are one of the brown-nosers in their hind pocket, then it doesn't matter what you do.  Most of the people are fun to work with, it's too bad the company policies aren't upheld as they are supposed to be. It often makes for a hostile work environment.

The best thing about being an employee for Home Depot is all the benefits they offer throughout the year (bonuses, bonus parties, Christmas party, pot sharing, and barbecues etc).

As a supervisor you are expected to give your life to that place. It is a solid company to work for but typical Politics of most job settings unfortunately handwork doesn't speak for itself and that was frustrating. The benefits and 401k are great. The pay can be really good if you move through the system the right way such as certain departments and positions. If you stay in the same position raises generally aren't that great. Bonuses can be good if your store performs well and success sharing.  If you are offered the opportunity to get training in ATL that was the best part of my time with the company, great and beneficial experience. As with any job there are pros and cons.

As long as you have the need for learning and love to work hard and not afraid of manual labor, this job is the greatest. The only hard part I found about this job picking up 5 gallon paint and unloading charcoal and broken pallets. That is it. The pay is so great, and the benefits are so wonderful.  All in all I would recommend this job to become a career for anyone ", " Home Depot culture is not what it protrays, I think they have to many bosses and not enough workers.  The employees work hard but are not appreciated.  Employees work only part time with no benefits which how Home Depot doesn't  have to pay medical benefit.  The employees that I worked with were dedicated to Home Depot but were not appreciated like they should of been.    I was with Home Depot a short time and I did enjoy my job but management as a whole needed to be revamp from the top down and get back to basic and learn to really see how there employees work hard for Home Depot. ", " I loved working for the Home Depot,. It was a very hard working and exciting working environment. I met so many nice people and learned so many great tools that I could use in life. They have ongoing knowledge about so many household and daily life situations. I've been very fortunate to learn so much while I was there. The work team and management was extremely helpful and they were always willing to help with me if I didn't understand something. The Hardest part of the job would probably be taking on a question you are not familiar with. But my favorite part about the job was always being able to find someone who would help you find an answer or solution to a question you are being asked. ", ' Home Depot prides themselves on teamwork and communication. The main focus is always on keeping customers and staff happy. Great community to be apart of, and admirable devotion to being involved in their residential communities. Regular donations to Habit for Humanity and The Orange Door Project for youth homeless. Associates are encouraged and expected to strive to learn more and take charge. Customer satisfaction is guaranteed number one. ', ' Even as a normal departmental associate, there is always something to be doing. Maintaining stock and pursuing answers for customers are most of the day but there are also many smaller tasks plainly laid out each morning. Within a year, I had moved up to being a full-time associate and soon after to being a specialist, all by merely doing my best every day (and making sure management knew it). The benefits for a full-time associate are comprehensive and clearly described, including 401K matching. Management is often seen wandering the sales floor and they wear the same aprons are the normal associates, meaning they end up helping customers just like the rest. ', " Typical day at work involved standing long periods of time on concrete floor, management tended to hire very immature young employees who didn't want to work and had negative attitudes, and were rude to customers and co workers.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with insubordinate co workers who liked to goof off and not pull their weight. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers and product knowledge. The company was always having contest and competitions among employees which did not help with low moral issues. ", ' During a typical work day there are many, many opportunities to get to know fellow Associates, follow up on leads and Operations discrepancies, and seek out patrons wishing to take advantage of The Home Depot.  THD is a great place to work and has competitive wages &amp; benefits packages.  The hardest part of the job was trying to keep with all the wants &amp; needs of the position.  Between Safety, Operations, and Theft &amp; Fraud there never seemed to be enough time in the day!  Luckily, a company cell phone and VPN allowed for a flexible schedule leading to greater results and increased work-life balance. ', " Continually expected to work 10 to 12 hours per day, they claim they don't but they schedule you for mandatory meetings that extend your day. Expected to be checking emails and give your personal cell for contact on your time off. Very low salary/pay, benefits ok, but the bonuses are no where near what they promise.  No one I met has ever received the promised 25% even if they exceed sales plan. They don't fire people often so job security is pretty good but then you have to work with below par employees that should have been fired in their probationary period. Everyone is tired.  There is no work/life balance and this impacts the culture. It is a retail environment so most people are upbeat and ready to give good customer service which can look deceiving.  Look deeper and you will see the reality. ", ' Nice starting job if your straight out of High School and need to acquire some work experience. They offer a variety of skill sets from cashiers to sales and warehouse duties. You will also learn and gain experience in the culture of large, "Coporate America", where they love young, inexperienced but motivated people to munipulate and promote their business model and agenda. As for a working adult, they neither pay enough to support a family or give enough hours to take part in the great benefits that they offer. But, if your 18 and out of school, and can afford to invest in several years of doing the deeds that move you up the ladder, you can may be get to some type of management position, where you will then receive a decent wage. ', " Other than the rotating door called management which never consists of the same cast you can learn a great deal and move up the internal hierarchy. They treat the lot associates poorly and overwork them, and hours can suck as most retail. However what sets them apart is the base salary which is higher than most, their flexibility with your life, sick and vacation time, as well as a wide variety of events and benefits. The biggest thing is they trust me to do my work and don't baby me or constantly check in on you. Great entry level job...just don't make a career out of it.

The hardest part of the job is the physical to that the work puts on your body over time with the heavy lifting and the constant different tasked asked of you. My management were like family, really approachable and they made you want to work hard for them. ', ' I have loved my time with this company and do find that it is very enjoyable to work in most stores. I do find the pay to be a little low especially for those that take their own time to learn new skills and receive extra training to not receive a pay raise.  I will warn you that if you are part time (I am not) that hours for the most part are very limited through most of the year with the exception of holidays (off seasons you can get as low as 6 hours for the week to 18 hours). You also will not receive benefits if you are only part time.  The good thing is that they do work with school and child care situations as long as you have the paper work to back up your needs.

As a supervisor you are expected to give your life to that place. It is a solid company to work for but typical Politics of most job settings unfortunately handwork doesn't speak for itself and that was frustrating. The benefits and 401k are great. The pay can be really good if you move through the system the right way such as certain departments and positions. If you stay in the same position raises generally aren't that great.

All in all I would recommend this job to become a career for anyone ", " Home Depot culture is not what it protrays, I think they have to many bosses and not enough workers.  The employees work hard but are not appreciated.  Employees work only part time with no benefits which how Home Depot doesn't  have to pay medical benefit.  The employees that I worked with were dedicated to Home Depot but were not appreciated like they should of been.    I was with Home Depot a short time and I did enjoy my job but management as a whole needed to be revamp from the top down and get back to basic and learn to really see how there employees work hard for Home Depot. ", " I loved working for the Home Depot,. It was a very hard working and exciting working environment. I met so many nice people and learned so many great tools that I could use in life. They have ongoing knowledge about so many household and daily life situations. I've been very fortunate to learn so much while I was there. The work team and management was extremely helpful and they were always willing to help with me if I didn't understand something. The Hardest part of the job would probably be taking on a question you are not familiar with. But my favorite part about the job was always being able to find someone who would help you find an answer or solution to a question you are being asked. ", ' Home Depot prides themselves on teamwork and communication. The main focus is always on keeping customers and staff happy. Great community to be apart of, and admirable devotion to being involved in their residential communities. Regular donations to Habit for Humanity and The Orange Door Project for youth homeless. Associates are encouraged and expected to strive to learn more and take charge. Customer satisfaction is guaranteed number one. ', ' Even as a normal departmental associate, there is always something to be doing. Maintaining stock and pursuing answers for customers are most of the day but there are also many smaller tasks plainly laid out each morning. Within a year, I had moved up to being a full-time associate and soon after to being a specialist, all by merely doing my best every day (and making sure management knew it). The benefits for a full-time associate are comprehensive and clearly described, including 401K matching. Management is often seen wandering the sales floor and they wear the same aprons are the normal associates, meaning they end up helping customers just like the rest. ', " Typical day at work involved standing long periods of time on concrete floor, management tended to hire very immature young employees who didn't want to work and had negative attitudes, and were rude to customers and co workers.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with insubordinate co workers who liked to goof off and not pull their weight. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers and product knowledge. The company was always having contest and competitions among employees which did not help with low moral issues. ", ' During a typical work day there are many, many opportunities to get to know fellow Associates, follow up on leads and Operations discrepancies, and seek out patrons wishing to take advantage of The Home Depot.  THD is a great place to work and has competitive wages &amp; benefits packages.  The hardest part of the job was trying to keep with all the wants &amp; needs of the position.  Between Safety, Operations, and Theft &amp; Fraud there never seemed to be enough time in the day!  Luckily, a company cell phone and VPN allowed for a flexible schedule leading to greater results and increased work-life balance. ', " Continually expected to work 10 to 12 hours per day, they claim they don't but they schedule you for mandatory meetings that extend your day. Expected to be checking emails and give your personal cell for contact on your time off. Very low salary/pay, benefits ok, but the bonuses are no where near what they promise.  No one I met has ever received the promised 25% even if they exceed sales plan. They don't fire people often so job security is pretty good but then you have to work with below par employees that should have been fired in their probationary period. Everyone is tired.  There is no work/life balance and this impacts the culture. It is a retail environment so most people are upbeat and ready to give good customer service which can look deceiving.  Look deeper and you will see the reality. ", ' Nice starting job if your straight out of High School and need to acquire some work experience. They offer a variety of skill sets from cashiers to sales and warehouse duties. You will also learn and gain experience in the culture of large, "Coporate America", where they love young, inexperienced but motivated people to munipulate and promote their business model and agenda. As for a working adult, they neither pay enough to support a family or give enough hours to take part in the great benefits that they offer. But, if your 18 and out of school, and can afford to invest in several years of doing the deeds that move you up the ladder, you can may be get to some type of management position, where you will then receive a decent wage. ', " Other than the rotating door called management which never consists of the same cast you can learn a great deal and move up the internal hierarchy. They treat the lot associates poorly and overwork them, and hours can suck as most retail. However what sets them apart is the base salary which is higher than most, their flexibility with your life, sick and vacation time, as well as a wide variety of events and benefits. The biggest thing is they trust me to do my work and don't baby me or constantly check in on you. Great entry level job...just don't make a career out of it.

My management were like family, really approachable and they made you want to work hard for them. ', ' I have loved my time with this company and do find that it is very enjoyable to work in most stores. I do find the pay to be a little low especially for those that take their own time to learn new skills and receive extra training to not receive a pay raise.  I will warn you that if you are part time (I am not) that hours for the most part are very limited through most of the year with the exception of holidays (off seasons you can get as low as 6 hours for the week to 18 hours). You also will not receive benefits if you are only part time.  The good thing is that they do work with school and child care situations as long as you have the paper work to back up your needs.

They have ongoing knowledge about so many household and daily life situations. I've been very fortunate to learn so much while I was there. The work team and management was extremely helpful and they were always willing to help with me if I didn't understand something.

", ' Even as a normal departmental associate, there is always something to be doing. Maintaining stock and pursuing answers for customers are most of the day but there are also many smaller tasks plainly laid out each morning. Within a year, I had moved up to being a full-time associate and soon after to being a specialist, all by merely doing my best every day (and making sure management knew it). The benefits for a full-time associate are comprehensive and clearly described, including 401K matching. Management is often seen wandering the sales floor and they wear the same aprons are the normal associates, meaning they end up helping customers just like the rest. ', " Typical day at work involved standing long periods of time on concrete floor, management tended to hire very immature young employees who didn't want to work and had negative attitudes, and were rude to customers and co workers.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with insubordinate co workers who liked to goof off and not pull their weight. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers and product knowledge. The company was always having contest and competitions among employees which did not help with low moral issues.

', " Other than the rotating door called management which never consists of the same cast you can learn a great deal and move up the internal hierarchy. They treat the lot associates poorly and overwork them, and hours can suck as most retail. However what sets them apart is the base salary which is higher than most, their flexibility with your life, sick and vacation time, as well as a wide variety of events and benefits. The biggest thing is they trust me to do my work and don't baby me or constantly check in on you. Great entry level job...just don't make a career out of it. ", " Iso loved working at the RDC.

The only hard part I found about this job picking up 5 gallon paint and unloading charcoal and broken pallets. That is it. The pay is so great, and the benefits are so wonderful.  All in all I would recommend this job to become a career for anyone ", ' I have loved my time with this company and do find that it is very enjoyable to work in most stores. I do find the pay to be a little low especially for those that take their own time to learn new skills and receive extra training to not receive a pay raise.  I will warn you that if you are part time (I am not) that hours for the most part are very limited through most of the year with the exception of holidays (off seasons you can get as low as 6 hours for the week to 18 hours). You also will not receive benefits if you are only part time.  The good thing is that they do work with school and child care situations as long as you have the paper work to back up your needs. ', ' Nice starting job if your straight out of High School and need to acquire some work experience. They offer a variety of skill sets from cashiers to sales and warehouse duties. You will also learn and gain experience in the culture of large, "Coporate America", where they love young, inexperienced but motivated people to munipulate and promote their business model and agenda. As for a working adult, they neither pay enough to support a family or give enough hours to take part in the great benefits that they offer. But, if your 18 and out of school, and can afford to invest in several years of doing the deeds that move you up the ladder, you can may be get to some type of management position, where you will then receive a decent wage. ', " I love working at the Home Depot RDC because there are a lot of opportunities to expand your skills and move up in the company.  It is always busy from day to day(except during the holidays where it tends to be slow). Probably the biggest thing you may have to overcome is the co-workers and their lack of attention to detail of the job requirements.  Outside of that, you get great benefits plus profit sharing bonuses every quarter and raises every year.  All you really need to do is do your job the way they require you to and show some ambition and you'll move ahead there. ", ' Environment was stimulating until poor quality began to seep into the management structure.  Compensation could have been improved also.  Compensation was not commensurate with worked performed and responsibilities assumed.  Felt highly esteemed by co-workers and customers alike, yet received just the opposite response from management.  Communication was way only and did not go uphill.  No feedback on submission of ideas to improve the company.  Praise rarely given.  Difficulty encountered in getting reimbursed for expenses. ', " overall HD is a good company but I can only Speak on my experience with my own store. When I first started there It was very hopeful and i was looking to grow, that idea quickly turned into a headache as I felt my management didn't have a a good grasp on how to maintain morale among staff (little to no recognition for achievements, constant negative critique), they practiced in favoritism (awards and promotions stayed within a particular circle) and it was very apparent to many of the staff. after awhile progression felt non existent no matter how much was put into the work. many times it felt as if our store didn't practice the Core Values that Home Depot preaches, but as I said my experience my particular store.

', " I love working at the Home Depot RDC because there are a lot of opportunities to expand your skills and move up in the company.  It is always busy from day to day(except during the holidays where it tends to be slow). Probably the biggest thing you may have to overcome is the co-workers and their lack of attention to detail of the job requirements.  Outside of that, you get great benefits plus profit sharing bonuses every quarter and raises every year.  All you really need to do is do your job the way they require you to and show some ambition and you'll move ahead there.

Compensation was not commensurate with worked performed and responsibilities assumed.  Felt highly esteemed by co-workers and customers alike, yet received just the opposite response from management.  Communication was way only and did not go uphill.  No feedback on submission of ideas to improve the company.  Praise rarely given.  Difficulty encountered in getting reimbursed for expenses.

When I first started there It was very hopeful and i was looking to grow, that idea quickly turned into a headache as I felt my management didn't have a a good grasp on how to maintain morale among staff (little to no recognition for achievements, constant negative critique), they practiced in favoritism (awards and promotions stayed within a particular circle) and it was very apparent to many of the staff. after awhile progression felt non existent no matter how much was put into the work. many times it felt as if our store didn't practice the Core Values that Home Depot preaches, but as I said my experience my particular store.

The employees that I worked with were dedicated to Home Depot but were not appreciated like they should of been.    I was with Home Depot a short time and I did enjoy my job but management as a whole needed to be revamp from the top down and get back to basic and learn to really see how there employees work hard for Home Depot.

They have ongoing knowledge about so many household and daily life situations. I've been very fortunate to learn so much while I was there. The work team and management was extremely helpful and they were always willing to help with me if I didn't understand something. The Hardest part of the job would probably be taking on a question you are not familiar with. But my favorite part about the job was always being able to find someone who would help you find an answer or solution to a question you are being asked.

Maintaining stock and pursuing answers for customers are most of the day but there are also many smaller tasks plainly laid out each morning. Within a year, I had moved up to being a full-time associate and soon after to being a specialist, all by merely doing my best every day (and making sure management knew it). The benefits for a full-time associate are comprehensive and clearly described, including 401K matching. Management is often seen wandering the sales floor and they wear the same aprons are the normal associates, meaning they end up helping customers just like the rest. ', " Typical day at work involved standing long periods of time on concrete floor, management tended to hire very immature young employees who didn't want to work and had negative attitudes, and were rude to customers and co workers.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with insubordinate co workers who liked to goof off and not pull their weight. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers and product knowledge. The company was always having contest and competitions among employees which did not help with low moral issues.

Luckily, a company cell phone and VPN allowed for a flexible schedule leading to greater results and increased work-life balance.

Expected to be checking emails and give your personal cell for contact on your time off. Very low salary/pay, benefits ok, but the bonuses are no where near what they promise.  No one I met has ever received the promised 25% even if they exceed sales plan. They don't fire people often so job security is pretty good but then you have to work with below par employees that should have been fired in their probationary period. Everyone is tired.  There is no work/life balance and this impacts the culture. It is a retail environment so most people are upbeat and ready to give good customer service which can look deceiving.  Look deeper and you will see the reality. ", ' Nice starting job if your straight out of High School and need to acquire some work experience.

They treat the lot associates poorly and overwork them, and hours can suck as most retail. However what sets them apart is the base salary which is higher than most, their flexibility with your life, sick and vacation time, as well as a wide variety of events and benefits.

I do find the pay to be a little low especially for those that take their own time to learn new skills and receive extra training to not receive a pay raise.  I will warn you that if you are part time (I am not) that hours for the most part are very limited through most of the year with the exception of holidays (off seasons you can get as low as 6 hours for the week to 18 hours).

The benefits for a full-time associate are comprehensive and clearly described, including 401K matching.

No one I met has ever received the promised 25% even if they exceed sales plan. They don't fire people often so job security is pretty good but then you have to work with below par employees that should have been fired in their probationary period. Everyone is tired.
